Not an issue for me, but might be an issue to drink muddy looking water for others.<br /><br />Overall, if you pay 2x or 3x price you can get a better product, This one works okay, neither very good nor very bad.",2015-08-31

I massaged this and occasionally tea tree oil in his hair every night for a few days, and it really cleared his flakes up! The tea tree oil helped, but this alone would be fine. I read it jojoba oil/wax is one of the closest substrates to human sebum (which our skin and scalp produce that make it oily). Seems to work that way. His scalp is realllllly dry and his hair is so thick it just kinda lays there (he can go like...5 days without washing his hair). So I apply very liberally throughout his whole scalp. Seems to do the trick! He loves how it makes his hair more manageable and actually &#34;do something&#34; (his words).<br /><br />Really great moisturizer too.

It looks nice sitting on my bedside table. It does seem a little inconsistent with how long it lasts, which might just have to do with the humidity in my room. Sometimes I can get more than two nights out of a single filling. Other times it's just one night. But it's always been at least one night.<br /><br />I'm sure it varies depending on the quality of oils you use, so I don't want to knock this product since I'm not certain if it's the reason, but I did notice that the scent of the oil is only noticeable for the first few hours. The steam does last all night though so that's good! It's not much steam though, so if you're hoping to use this also as a humidifier I don't think it would work very well.<br /><br />I have two main complaints with this. The first is removing the lid to refill it. I have pretty severe repetitive motion injuries and some nights after a hard day at work I can't quite grip it well enough to open it. It's a pretty wide smooth surface you have to grip to twist it open. And it's not the easiest to put back on either. So if anyone has an injury or illness that makes it difficult to open jars or anything then this will probably give you some issues as well. The second issue I have is the lights under the buttons are crazy bright! I like sleeping in dark, as dark as possible. I put electrical tape over the buttons which helped. But the light still reflects a little bit up through the white top. It's not unbearable, but I'd prefer if there was some way to keep it from lighting up at all. Take note, I'm not talking about the light feature because that can be turned off. I'm talking about the light built into the buttons to signal different things (like whether it's on or not) that can't be turned off.",2015-08-31

It's so much like sugar and even has the mouth-feel of sugar. I always feel like I'm cheating when I eat it, but I don't get any weight gain or blood sugar surges. I love stevia too, but it's only good in certain things. Swerve is great in everything. I've served it to people without telling them it wasn't sugar, and no one knew the difference.

The feeling is similar to what it feels like when you eat way too much sugar. Yet when I tested my blood sugar, it hadn't gone up. Both my boyfriend and I experienced this on both occasions after eating a piece of cake made with this sweetener. The cake taste great, but I won't be buying this again.",2015-08-31

I had several tears that were 2nd degree tears including a brutal episiotomy and severe hemorrhoids. My body was battered and bruised after 36hrs in labor and 4 hrs of pushing. I remember two days after coming home from the hospital and just crying in the shower because I had severe PTSD from L&D and also I was so wrecked in my most sensitive area that I was in constant pain.<br /><br />My care routine consisted of witch hazel diluted with water in my peribottle that I stole from the hospital (it really was my best friend after I would use the bathroom) but right next up the peribottle was this new mama bottom spray. After I would clean up with the peribottle I would spray this on and although I was so numb and swollen down there that I couldn't feel much of a cooling sensation. I loved the smell and the idea that it was helping me heal.<br /><br />More than two weeks postpartum I'm back in my feet and still using this spray which is in fact very cooling and very refreshing.

With Yohimbe, HMB, Choline. All Natural, 45 Servings.",Health & Personal Care,4,6,12,N,N,"Great supplement, label a little misleading","I don't write supplement reviews but Forge deserves one.first, be forewarned about the yohimbine in Forge. I am used to yohimbine, so I had no ill effects from it. It is powerful if you've never used it. Follow the instructions. Start at half the dosage and increase one pill at a time until you reach the full dose for your weight.<br /><br />I have trained fasted during my one year on the Bigger Leaner Stronger program. The problem for me had always been that I had ZERO energy or focus during fasted workouts, especially on leg day even when taking my normal pre-workout. I often switched to less taxing exercises when training fasted to compensate (e.g. skipping squats and doing leg presses instead, or skipping deadlifts on back day). My weights were ALWAYS lower. I was always drained after just a few sets. Enter Forge. I have used it three times now for leg day, chest and tris and a fasted cardio day. The difference is night and day. I've used yohimbine during fasted training, so that's not the difference. I believe the key difference to be the citicoline. During these workouts with Forge I had crazy focus and my energy was sustained through the entire workout. I was able to get through my squats and even go up in weight (275 lbs for 3 sets of 6). On chest day I was able to go up in weight on bench press AND a machine press (yes I know machines are bad, but I like to use this particular machine on occasion). This had never happened before during fasted training. I wanted to make sure this wasn't the placebo effect so I waited three workouts to post this. Repeated results = score. Needless to say, I am a Forge customer.<br /><br />Now, for my one complaint, which is the only reason I have four stars instead of five. I have five of Mike's books, which should tell you what I think of his work. I'm on his blog almost daily. I'm glad he's leading the charge against proprietary blends and junk science. That being said, the label on Forge says 30 servings. This is only trueif you weigh one hundred pounds. The full dose is one pill per twenty-five pounds of bodyweight. For the full dose, for example, one bottle will be fifteen doses for a 200-pound person. So instead of it being thirty servings at about one dollar per, it's actually fifteen servings at two dollars per. This might be something worth considering for the budget conscious among us.<br /><br />To be fair, this could have something to do with how Legion defines a serving, but it's still misleading in my opinion. Closely read the label prior to purchase.<br /><br />As long as you are aware of this, buy away. Forge is worth the money if you want to train fasted and have your full energy through the workout. I'm sold. It's truly a unique supplement.",2015-08-31

I only wore it in the pool, because I was afraid to chance the ocean (waves were rough, didn't want it to get knocked loose). I took advice of others and wrapped my cast in an Velcro style ACE bandage first, to avoid snagging.  The item is HUGE. I am 5'3&#34;, but because of the elbow bend I measured an adult large.  It looked absurd, but once vacuumed it was tight enough that it didn't really matter.  I wrapped the (excessive amount) of extra cover around my hand with a rubber band.  You just need to be careful..it can vacuum really tightly... I wasn't always able to wear it for a long time.  The only reason I'm giving 4 stars and not 5, is because you need to be careful that it doesn't roll down at the top when you put it on, otherwise air can get it.

I have various allergies and, even with the air gap issue, it still works well enough so my nose doesn't constantly run when I'm exposed to various molds and excessive dust.<br /><br />Unfortunately it doesn't help with smoking and car exhaust, which was one of my reasons for buying it.  When I looked at the company's products, I noticed they had a specific filter for gas and smoke emissions, so I went ahead and bought the latest model.  Unfortunately that filter doesn't work with this model, but that was my fault, as I should have did my research better.<br /><br />Fit-wise, it stays in fine for me.  If I had to tell others how it feels, I would say it feels like having a large booger in my nose.  Ease-of-breathing is also similar to having a large booger in your nose -- it's noticeably restricted, but you can still breathe.  After awhile I got used to it and didn't think of it anymore.<br /><br />If your nose runs a lot or you eat spicy foods that cause your nose to run, this filter isn't a good fit.  The cloth filter will soak up the stuff trying to get out of your nose and become extremely difficult to breathe with.  It gets really nasty at that point, so remember to remove it before that happens.<br /><br />On the air gap: imaging a sheet of paper lying flat on a desk.  Now put your hands on the opposite ends of the paper.  Next, push down and inwards (toward the other hand) about an inch on both sides.  See that gap where the paper is forced off the desk?  That's what happens here.  Manipulating the filter to fit snugly in your nose causes a gap just like this.  If they increase the actual filter's size so it wraps around the black thing that sets it in place (instead of just resting on top of it), this gap would probably be closed.<br /><br />On looks: The filter turns my nose into a pug-nose.  The bottom strap (connecting the two pieces that go into your nostrils) is still visible, especially if you're tall and people look up at you.  If you're short, it isn't as big of a deal.  If you're tall and people are close (and they're short), they can see the white filter when they look up at you.<br /><br />On voice: This does affect the sound of my voice (noticed not only by me, but by others).  It sounds like you have a stuffed nose when you're sick, just not to that extreme.  It does affect your voice negatively, though.<br /><br />Other: My initial purchase had two sets of filters missing from the packets that were included.  The packets were there, but nothing was in it.  The packets weren't opened either (you could play around with the pockets of air, showing it was still sealed).  Annoying.<br /><br />Bottom-line?  I'll still use it.  The air gap needs to be dealt with, though, and it erodes the primary purpose of the product.",2015-08-31

It's very convenient  for quickly freshening up your breath before an appointment/meeting/date/etc. The small size of the brush means you can actually brush behind the molars, which gives you that freshly cleaned teeth feeling.<br /><br />It's not really a con but as I noted at the start of my review the brushes are not individually wrapped. That means you can't just throw one or two in your gym back/pocket/travel bag before you go somewhere. You need to bring the entire pack or put a few in a ziplock or something. Some of the smaller packs (2 pack, 6 pack) you buy at the store are individually wrapped or bundle wrapped, so they might be more convenient, when you're trying to save space.<br /><br />Overall, I definitely love the Colgate Wisp product and this 96 count package is an excellent buy.",2015-08-31

I've tried lotions, pumice stones, and manual shaver style tools in the past, but did not get great or consistent results. I have not used this electric unit many times yet, but after trying it just a couple of times, it does seem to do the trick. I have only used the softer roller so far, but it has been enough for the toughest parts of my feet, and is also gentle enough that I'm not as scared of hurting myself as I initially was when thinking about an electric-powered tool to my feet. The operation is pretty straight-forward, but there is a small insert that explains how to operate and also charge and care for the unit. It charges pretty quickly, and changing out the roller heads is very easy. I appreciate that a couple of different rollers are included, and the kit even includes a small brush to help with cleaning and maintaining the unit. I also like the slight tilt below the head of the unit, as it does make it more comfortable to operate, and still see where I am working. I have not yet tried it in water, but that is another great feature that I can see taking advantage of in the future. I'm glad I gave this a shot, and I hope it will keep my feet in better shape going forward.",2015-08-31

I have issues with a wonky immune system, due to Lupus. Considering that it runs in my family, I was diagnosed early at 21 yrs old. I have incorporated eastern + western medicine, with success. I'm lucky to be in relatively good health.<br />  I've used colloidal silver in the past. It's helped me get through bacterial & viral infections much faster than the usual time it takes me to heal. Unfortunately, silver remedies are usually super expensive!<br />  This bottle couldn't have been delivered at a better time! Less than 24 hours before, my left eardrum had ruptured from a middle ear infection. I'd already been to the doctor, and had started antibiotics.<br />  I was amazed by the 32oz. size~especially, for the price. I've spent the same amount on a 4oz!<br />  The solution isn't cloudy~it's clear & seems pure. It doesn't taste awful or have a metallic aftertaste. It's actually quite mild and hasn't irritated my stomach at all.(I had that issue with a previous silver product) *Just remember to swish it as long as you can stand, since it's absorbs into your system quicker sublingually.<br />  This past week, I've taken 3 teaspoons 3x's a day, since I'm sick. On the 2nd & 3rd day, I was feeling a bit better. I wasn't as listless, and had energy, which for me is highly unusual while fighting off an infection.<br />  By day 4, my swollen glands had subsided, and even though I was experiencing some ear pain + my equilibrium was still off, I felt able to do tasks around the house. My hubby kept telling me~ &#34;Leave the laundry & dishes alone, stop cleaning and go rest! I'll take care of the house, you need to to take care of you!&#34; (he's such a good guy:) Even though I wasn't &#34;drained&#34;, and had gumption, I gave in and rested.<br />  By day 6, i was doing cartwheels! No~ I'm just kidding!! But, I am feeling much better than I know I should.<br />  I went to my doctors appointment, yesterday. He was genuinely surprised by how quickly I was healing. I told him about the daily silver supplement, and brought the bottle in to show him. He told me to keep on taking it, and to reduce (over the next couple days) to the standard daily dose.<br />  I'm thoroughly impressed with this oral liquid nano-silver. It works wonders, and has improved my quality of health. It will be a staple in my household, from now on!

Another advantage i see above other brands is that you only need one scoop per serving. ISO100 helps a lot with muscle recovery since i do not feel sore the day after training when drinking it. Overall, i feel a light improvement on strength and endurance. However, if you are very very skinny i do not recommend this protein.

I received the product fairly quickly after ordering, so kudos on the shipping department. I have been on the supplement for two days now and I must admit IT HELPS! I take one capsule early each AM regardless of what the recommended suggestions was. The pills were not LARGE like most diet supplements and it did help to suppress my appetite. I didnt notice any bad side effects such as sweating, or anxiety as most supplements give off. I cannot tell as of yet whether it helps to burn fat, but will be able to notice fairly quickly if it does in that department as the Dukan diet helps to get rid of stored fat. I recommend this product to anyone starting off on a diet or anyone looking for supplements to curb their appetites, it is made of ALL NATURAL ingredients and no SIDE EFFECTS from my point of view!

The reason for the purchase was to clear up a bad stench coming from a room where I have the cat litter box placed (and of course where the cats do their business).  The GermGuardian AC4825 did the trick.  With this GermGuardian AC5300B, I was expecting similar positive results, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />The AC4825 unit stands at 22-inches, is intended for small to medium sized room, and has a Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) rating of 100+.  The AC5300B unit stands at 28-inches, is intended for medium to large sized rooms and has a CADR rating of 125+.  [CADR rating can be verified online.  However, for whatever reason, I could not find Germ Guardian's products on the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) website.]<br /><br />Both units touts a 3-in-1 filter -- that is, it has a HEPA filter to capture 99.7% of airborne particles, a charcoal filter to capture odors, and a pre-filter to capture large dust particles, lint and pet hair.  Additionally, it has a UV-C light that kills bacteria and viruses, and helps get rid of odor caused by smoking, cooking, and pets.<br /><br />As this model is intended for a medium to larger room, I have this placed in the kitchen/dining room.  In my household, we sometimes eat durian and stinky tofu.  The smells tend to linger a bit.  With this air purifier on, the odors went away quicker than normal, and the aroma didn't spread to the entire house!<br /><br />This air purifier works well, and is relatively affordable for what it does.  I would recommend this product.",2015-08-31

They come all in one small box and are basically interlocked into one another.<br /><br />When you use these to massage your head, it feels amazing, at first. Then you have to stop because for one reason or another it just doesn't feel as good anymore. I guess your scalp just gets used to it. Perhaps it's kind of like when you have an itch you need to scratch and you manage to scratch it so you have to stop. This is a situation where you didn't even know you had an itch that needed scratching.<br /><br />Also, this tickles some people and feels weird to others. Use at your own risk.<br /><br />Finally, I personally love the product, but a couple of the massagers came broken. One had a broken metal wire and another was missing the black plastic end that makes it feel pleasant and not like there's a sharp nail tearing at your scalp. Needless to say, I had to toss a couple of them. Still a good buy over all.",2015-08-31

Finally when one bag of my decade-old ones got a larger-than-intended hole in it, I immediately sought out ECOBAGS on Amazon.<br /><br />This bag is so comfortable on the shoulder. I (like most people, I suspect) like to torture myself by attempting to carry all of my grocery bags into the house at once, because second trips to the car are for quitters. So this bag is incredible, because I can sling it over my shoulder or ever across my body comfortably without it digging into me. This is invaluable because it frees up my hands to carry more bags.<br /><br />It's light weight but very strong. I like that I can stuff it in my purse and have it on hand for groceries and the farmer's market. A woman actually stopped me in the store once and asked where I got this, she had lived in Europe years ago and used a similar product there for 20 years without issue and was so sad to not find any here in America when she returned to live here. These bags are that good.<br /><br />The last time I checked, this brand also has smaller grain/rice/produce bags made of cloth.

The Deen Peen is a fantastic f@ck. It is everything I hoped it would be and more. And it is definitely more: nine inches in length, SIX inches of girth (I measured. You’re welcome), and balls the size of an orange.<br /><br />I’ve heard some rumblings about the balls being too big. Personally, I thought the balls 1) look great; and 2) serve a very useful purpose allowing you to use them almost like a handle to maneuver the c@ck up your vag (or a$$, whichever). There’s also a suction cup on the bottom that I can tell you works well in the shower.<br /><br />I tested this thing so hard. Just for you.<br /><br />During its maiden voyage, I used the Deen Peen with my husband, so technically I had a threesome with JD. I’m just going to start telling everyone that. However, you could easily use this on a solo mission.<br /><br />When you first open the package it sort of smells a little bit – it is silicone afterall – but after a good cleaning with some Before & After Toy Cleaner JD was ready to go, smell-free. The dildo is quite softer than others on the market, and while not the real thing (obviously) the characterization as ‘realistic’ is pretty true.<br /><br />My husband volunteered as tribute for a side-by-side comparison because, SCIENCE. The real deal is clearly warmer and even softer, but The Deen Peen gets really high marks for its realism. The dildo is also sort of bendable, just like a real penis, and doesn’t jar you like a hard piece of plastic would. I HATE plastic toys for this reason. From just presentation and feel alone, I was thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />That girth though. Oh-Em-Gee. I wasn’t expecting that. I mean, six inches in girth isn’t really something you encounter daily. Ok. It’s not something I encounter daily. I highly recommend trying James out with a whole lot of lube, especially if you’re not used to something so…uhhh, girthy…..or lengthy, for that matter.<br /><br />The latter wasn’t my problem *waggles eyebrows*.<br /><br />Honestly, I was worried it was going to be a little too big, but thankfully there was nothing to be concerned about. Yes, it took a minute or so to adjust (that effing girth), but once adequate lube was used, it was like it was made for me…and isn’t that the point?<br /><br />While it’s never going to replace the real thing ( husbands and partners can calm down) adding JD into the mix was a LOT of fun, and it’s certainly a good alternative if you don’t have a partner available.<br /><br />Sizeable, soft & pliable, the Deen Peen is a Monster C@ck worthy of celebration. This monstrosity gets the whole five stars & I highly recommend for one-handed reading. Now if only they could make a Deen Tounge…it was going to be a little too big, but thankfully there was nothing to be concerned about. Yes, it took a minute or so to adjust (that effing girth), but once adequate lube was used, it was like it was made for me…and isn’t that the point?

I lost a lot of hair with my 2 children.  I do lots of research though, and soon learned why the hair loss occurs and that it would grow back.  It did.... however, it never again grew back to the left it had been before, which was about 2 inches below the bra strap on my back.  My pregnancies had affected the anagen phase (growing phase) of my hair by shortening it.  I did not cut my hair for SIX years, not even a trim, and my hair refused to grow longer, it remained 1 inch above my bra strap, and refused to grow back to where it was.<br />That said, my hair WAS growing normally!  I dye my hair, so it is easy to measure the growth in a months time, by measuring the length of my natural color at the root between touching up the color.  My average growth rate was 1 inch per month.  Thats really good growth, right?  So then why was my hair staying the same length?<br />I did research into the growth cycle of head hair, and discovered why.  The anagen phase controls how long the hair will grow before it is shed.  Apparently, because the growing phase of my hair was shortened by pregnancy hormones that permanently changed it... my hair was spending less time growing and fell out sooner, leading to shorter hair, and the length it had grown to above my bra band was the maximum limit now.  No fair!  I wanted to kn I w if I could change that at all, maybe take hormones or something.  I researched stuff like monixidil  for women, but those products are for people that are losing too much hair and gave thinning hair.  I wasn't going bald, I was going SHORT.  I also read about biotin, but the thing with biotin is, it does nothing for you unless you have a biotin deficiency, which I did not.  It also will do nothing to make hair LONGER.  It just helps it to grow at a normal rate if you are deficient.<br />  SO.... I purchased these supplements after having read that some people have had success in lengthening the amount of time their hair follicles would spend in the anagen phase and hopefully lengthen that phase, thus lengthen my hair overall.  So I purchased 2 bottles, because I also read that it takes 3 months to kick in.<br />  Each bottle contains 2 months worth of doses (if you take the minimum dose of 2 pills each day).  I'm a HUGE skeptic.  I dont trust anything, but I'm certainly game to try.<br />  I took 2 pills per day and after emptying the first bottle, I had zero length.  I wasn't shocked.  I honestly didn't expect the pills would do anything at all.  But, by the time I had finished the second bottle (nearly 4 months) my hair was at the middle of my bra strap accross my back!!<br />I was completely  floored.  After SIX years of no noticeable change in the length of my hair, my hair was growing longer!<br />  Now, I am on my third bottle, halfway through and my hair is still growing.  I'm completely amazed, and totally happy.  My hair has grown 2 inches longer in 5 months.<br />I'm  going to keep using MS as long as I need to to keep it growing longer.  With luck, it will go back to the length it was before I had children :)",2015-08-31

Being a mommy of two toddlers one special needs, finding any time for me is little to none, always on the run, it has been hard for me to take it correctly (45-60 min before meals) most of the time I am digging in my purse at meal time on the go, so I don't feel I can accurately talk about the results when I can't follow the rules.  On a positive note I do believe I have seen it assist with 'energy' as far as weight loss I have not seen any.

I am attempting to duplicate a sinus wash product that works great, and it contains Pau D'Arco as one of the ingredients.<br /><br />One thing I discovered right off the bat is that this Pau D'Arco solution is NOT water soluble. Hence the glycerine (or alcohol) used to act as a solvent. I found if I dropped some into DI water, the droplets would not dissolve. However, it does seem to be quite soluble in Aloe Vera juice (100 % pure, not gel), and the formulation I am trying to duplicate also contains quite a bit of aloe vera. When added to the aloe vera, it dissolves nicely, and stays in solution when the aloe vera is added to the 1% saline and xylitol in the nasal rinse.<br /><br />But the nasal rinse is not the amazing application I found for this stuff. I have some weird skin lesions on my scalp that are part scar tissue from a wound I got when I was a child. A section of this tissue is dark in color and bleeds at times, especially if irritated when the area is shaved. None of the OTC creams or antibiotic lotions, or aloe vera gel, work in healing this tissue. I decided to try the Pau D'Arco after reading about it's healing properties. I mixed about 5-10 drops in a teaspoon of aloe vera juice and applied the mix with a Q-tip to the dark colored tissue. Covered with a band aid with the pad soaked in the aloe solution and treated once a day for about a week. After a week's time the dark tissue was completely gone, no more bleeding. I was blown away, as I have been living with this nuisance off and on for most of my life.<br /><br />Like I said, amazing stuff.",2015-08-31

I cannot get it to track my heart rate consistently if I wear it the recommended way, which is the back of the wrist. I am a very dark complected black male, and I've read that the LEDs could potentially have a hard time shining through my skin to get the readings it needs, or perhaps I'm dead and don't realize it, but the only way I can get a consistent hear rate is wearing the device on the front of my wrist, which Fitbit does not want you to do. I only took off one star because Fitbit's customer service was great even though my issue never really got resolved. Wearing the Fitbit on the front of your wrist also negates the Quick View function, which makes the time show up when you move your wrist in a motion like you were checking the time. I have not tried high intensity exercise with it yet, which I also hear is hit or miss, but it seems to count my steps pretty accurately, and the silent alarm is great for when I need to get up and not disturb my wife. The caller ID scrolling is a little gimmicky, but nice when the phone isn't right beside me. I'm hoping they implement text scrolling at some point. I'll update this review when I get back to my HIIT workout routine, or if Fitbit figures out how to make the heart rate work on the back of my wrist.",2015-08-31

It comes with 250 grams of creatine in a lightweight resealable pouch. It's perfect for keeping at the office. The creatine itself is very fine with no fillers. I was expecting it to be grainier since it's mono but it actually is closer to the texture of creapure, which is more of a powder. That means it mixes well with whatever you decide to take it with. Sometimes I take it in a protein shake, or some flavored water, pre-workout, etc. Works well in each of those situations when I used it.<br /><br />Most pre-workouts usually come with some creatine already in it. However, the one I use only comes with 1 gram per serving. Recommended daily dosage of creatine is around 5 grams so I use the micronized creatine to reach that amount. You get 250 grams in the WellBodyNaturals product so that is about 50 servings. If you take one serving a day you should be good for about a month and a half. The instructions on the package recommend you load the creatine for 5 days but it's really not necessary. Your body will increase it's creatine stores over time and it can only take so much creatine in at a time anyway.<br /><br />The creatine will help you work out longer and cut down on muscle soreness. Most people will also put on some water weight, which makes you look bigger and it gives you more leverage, so you can lift heavier. There are some non-responders to creatine, so keep that in mind. Definitely make sure to remember to drink water otherwise it's possible to get some muscle cramping.<br /><br />One thing I do have to mention is the creatine comes in a resealable pouch. The problem with the pouch is it's really hard to get the zipper lining closed properly. The teeth are just too narrow. I don't think that's a deal breaker though. It's easy enough to use an extra tub, bag clip, rubber band, etc.<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend the WellBodyNaturals pure micronized creatine for anyone looking for good quality creatine that's easy to mix and contains no fillers.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",2015-08-31

I emailed BulkSupplements asking for clarification on this point, and they haven't responded.  But based on the product labelling, taste (there's a big difference--R-ALA kind of burns your tongue and throat, Na-RALA just tastes slightly salty), and solubility in water, I'm willing to bet that this is plain old R-ALA.<br /><br />The research indicates that there's a very big difference between Na-RALA and R-ALA.  Turns out, R-ALA may be worse even than racemic R/S-ALA.  Basically, while S-ALA is probably biologically inert, it improves the bioavailability of the R-ALA.  R-ALA by itself (if I remember correctly) just polymerizes/breaks down in the stomach.  Na-RALA is better than rac-ALA and R-ALA.<br /><br />From this (http://www.anaturalhealingcenter.com/documents/Thorne/articles/R-Lipoic12-4.pdf) study:<br /><br />&#34;The current study and previous findings from this laboratory conclude that pure RLA is not suitable for use<br />in nutraceutical or pharmaceutical products. Rather, it should be treated as raw material for further<br />processing into stable, bioavailable dosage forms. PK data reveals pure RLA is significantly<br />less bioavailable than RLA found as a 50-percent component of<br />rac-LA; and RLA in a salt form is considerably more bioavailable than an equivalent dose of racLA<br />(RLA + SLA).&#34;<br /><br />(Note, this study was written by someone at Geronova, which makes a Na-RALA product, so<br />take it with a grain of salt.  But there is a consensus among researchers I think.)<br /><br />If you look at the attached graph (from a powerpoint I can't find the link to right now), you see that R-ALA is hardly<br />absorbed at all.  Pretty useless.  Regret this purchase.<br /><br />I give two stars because the product is labelled accurately, and it's my own fault that I didn't do my homework before<br />buying it.",2015-08-31

I have tried many different types of products, some as expensive as $85. I have learned with this product that higher cost does not make the product better.

I got it for camping, but it is so handy and my work has me outside so much that I nearly always keep it in my purse or clipped to my belt in the carry case. I love being able to pee with ease, and have learned to position and let flow quickly so I can go on the trail without being noticed by other hikers. I have found that it works flawlessly except when I am frantic to pee; it's hard to get the position just right when my bladder is screaming, and I have had a handful of accidents. I have Irritable Bladder Syndrome and have to pee very suddenly, urgently and frequently, so I use my P-Style a lot. It is worth the few mishaps I have had for the convenience of being able to pee quickly, cleanly and discreetly. It works great standing or squatting; make sure to lean forward and pee facing downhill.  It does not work for peeing into a bottle while sitting in a car. I found it impossible to tilt forward enough due to the angle of the car seat, and the pee overflowed the p-style and flooded my seat. That was a fun predicament!  I might try that again when not under pressure -  maybe if one scootched forward to the edge of the seat and pointed the device down. Getting stuck in city traffic jams has led to bladder torture on so many occasions, I hope to find a solution to this dilemma.<br /><br />I like that I can wipe myself with the device and shake it clean. I just wash it with soap and water when I get home, and send the carry bag through the wash sometimes. The handmade carry bag I ordered from their website is cute and functional, closes with velcro and has a little loop for attaching to your backpack or whatevs. I replaced the loop when it broke last year, finding that that device is too long and bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket. Now the carry bag stays on a carabiner, ready to clip to me or my bag. No one knows what it is from the outside, but I love to tell my lady friends about my p-style and how liberating it is. Finally, we can correct our anatomy disadvantages to pee with the same ease as men.<br /> Today I went for a long walk in the Arboretum and of course brought my trusty funnel. As I got into the car, the funnel that was clipped to my belt got closed in the car door. Thinking no more of it, I went walking, pulled out the P-Style an hour into my nature walk, and discovered that it had shattered. I was suprised because this is a very hardy piece of plastic with a bit of give to it; I must have hit it just wrong. What a pain to have to find secluded spots to squat!<br /><br />I am loathe to buy new plastic and would appreciate a p-style made of recycled plastic. However, barring a direct hit like closing it in a car door, the p-style is very durable and should last a lifetime, so at least we aren't cluttering up landfills with worn-out p-styles. The cost is very reasonable, I will be getting a new one for sure.",2015-08-31

Try It For Yourself!,"With respect to all the women who've had problems with this product, I have to say that Monistat has been the number one product for me since my earlier, youthful days when they first became a need. Monistat is a trusted brand and has never failed me in over 4 decades. I was shocked to hear of the unfortunate problems some of the women had. It pained me greatly, being a woman, to think of others in such pain, especially considering that this product in particular has always brought me the relief I needed. In fact, the only reason I'd ever stopped using Monistat 1 is because I wasn't able to afford the $19 - $21 price range in the store. I'd ended up trying the $14 off brands in the store only to find they did not work as well and I ended up having to buy the more expensive Monistat 1 anyway. I didn't want to do the 3 day or 7 day products. One day and get it over with was my motto.<br /><br />SO, when I thought to see if Amazon carried the product I needed and found that they did AND at this wonderful price, my heart soared sky high. I could not believe my eyes.<br /><br />THEN I read the negative reviews, which I always do before I read the positive. I wondered if some bogus seller was on Amazon selling old, outdated kits, or some knock off that looked like Monistat. Then I said, let me try it for myself and see. I did and I'm SO glad that I did. I bought a number of these and will definitely be buying more as well as recommending other women to do so. Every woman is different, so for those of us for whom this works, buying it is a no-brainer.<br /><br />Being a diabetic, I tend to have more yeast infections when my sugar is running high which is often. I can't afford store prices and last I checked doctor's weren't prescribing yeast infection remedies, or insurances weren't paying for them, whichever.

You NEED to get Activa Naturals Sleep Supplement NOW!,"Activa Naturals Sleep Supplement has far exceeded my expectations.

I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and sleep trouble is one of the problems that many of us deal with on a regular basis.<br /><br />It normally takes about 10mg of Melatonin to get me to sleep.

Revolutionary Nutrient-rich Premium Formula for Every Eye Concern",Health & Personal Care,5,0,0,N,N,"Works really well, it just takes time...","I have tried other products from Joyal Beauty and they have all been of good quality.  When I was offered this eye cream for review I was happy to try it.  I have used this gel for 24 days, twice a day without a miss.  I am very diligent with products like this because I know how important it is to see how long they take to begin seeing results.<br /><br />This gel smells delicious, like fresh cucumbers.  It takes about 30 seconds to absorb and it goes really well under your regular moisturizer.  I use a pump and that's enough for both eyes and even a little extra that ends up on my forehead.  After 5 applications, I was able to notice a change on the puffiness of my eyes.  Let me tell you, I look like a raccoon with puffy eyes in the summer.  Our days are pretty long here at our small farm and I don't get enough sleep.<br /><br />At two weeks I was able to feel softer skin.  And at three weeks I noticed the skin around my eyes was brighter.  Vitamin C serums brighten up the skin but they can be too strong for your eyes and cause irritation.  This gel is gentle.  Doesn't have a huge amount of Vitamin C but for that reason, it takes a bit longer to work.<br /><br />Now, 47 applications later, my eyes look much better - even though I still don't get enough sleep.  But I have to say that the gel surprised me when I began to see some fine lines look smoother, not quite disappeared but wow...just wow.<br /><br />I was also curious to know how long this bottle would last.  The container is not transparent so it is difficult to guess.  I opened the bottle and I seem to have around 3/4 of gel left.  I also weighed the amount of gel that comes with one pump (very consistent amount) to see if I could get an average.  I think that at this rate, the gel would last me approximate 2 months - give or take a week.  This is with two applications everyday.<br /><br />In conclusion, natural, fairly balanced gel, good for even delicate skin, and good price for it - a bit less than 18 dlls at the moment.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.lls at the moment.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.",2015-08-31

My go to cookware either Visions cookware/Corningware stove top, or Simax as they are low maintenance and foods taste better (my liking) compare w/ All-Clad (slightly having metal taste, esp. soups). I only using All-Clad for searing meats/seafood and eggs and using Bar Keeper Friends to clean them.  After using BKF and Bon Ami, I prefer Bon Ami (original ingredients) better than BKF as: 1. Bon Ami have no odour hence BKF have strong (chemical?) odour and cost me headache 2. Bon Ami isn't irritate my hands (slightly dry only) hence BKF is (itchy) though I wish Bon Ami packaging have different design so can be closed after used Another thing BA isn't making All-Clad sets shiny like BKF, only clean dove though I can still see my face in them :D which the fact I don't really care. Most important things are I have no headache and itchy skin when using the product Bon Ami is better choice for me  updating oct 2015: just cleans my husband's silver necklace from bali ,, wow ,, omg! cleans, sparkling again as if we bought it like a decade ago now he is wearing it again w big smile, getting ready for his boys night out w his mates so happy making hubby happy ,, thank you bon ami ,, thank you amazon",2015-08-31

When I first pulled it out of the box, I thought it might be a little uncomfortable because the kneading balls stuck out more than I had imagined that they would.  However, when I tried it out, I was shocked by how good it felt.  I tried it on my lower back, my upper back, my neck, and my legs.  I love that it included a car adapter!  My husband and I go on long road trips every summer, and this massager pillow is small enough that we will definitely be carrying it with us.  The biggest problem with this neck and back massager is that it should come as a set of two so couples don't fight over whose turn it is to use it!  I'm giving this item five stars, but there are two other things I wish LiBa would address.  First, I wish that the heating element would get a little bit hotter.  Second, I wish they would add straps that would allow me to just strap the pillow on to my body so I could keep using it as I walk around and do things.  A person can dream, right?!  I was fortunate to purchase this item for review during a promotional period. These are my honest and unbiased opinions based only on my experience with the product.

Iodine-free multis are nearly impossible to find, so I was thrilled to find out that GNC made one for women, and I ran right out to buy two bottles. After getting home, I read the bottle more closely and discovered that they contain sucralose. I was SO disappointed. Sucralose kills off good gut bacteria and has other negative side effects.  I can't figure out why a company that promotes health would put sucralose in their vitamins. I don't need my vitamins to taste sugary for the few seconds they are in my mouth before I swallow.  If GNC feels sweetness is a necessity, I would prefer stevia, or even actual sugar to the sucralose.  ****UPDATE: I emailed GNC a while ago, requesting that they remove the sucralose from this vitamin.  I just checked their new bottles, and the bottle lists stevia instead of sucralose.  Kudos GNC.  I doubt it was my email that did the trick, but maybe they received several like minded requests.",2015-08-31

Sneezing, sniffling, watery eyes- you name it. We have every symptom imaginable, and our stuffy little house does not help. I have always been into herbal remedies (read a few of my other reviews if you enjoy herbal alternatives yourself for my opinions on other products), so when I saw this aroma therapy oil targeted towards colds and allergies, I knew I had to try it. I have lightly experimented with aroma therapy in the past, but haven't delved too deeply into a lot of the medical properties. I mainly just used lavender oil as a sleep aid- so the idea that this one could help with allergies was very interesting to me,<br /><br />I have a woodstove in my home. All essential oils that I use in terms of aroma therapy I add to some water and then let them evaporate into the air by placing them on my woodstove in a ceramic bowl. This scent is very interesting and robust- a bit spicy and strong, but immediately upon opening the bottle you can sense the medical properties in it. It has that very citrus/pine smell that you'd expect from something that is going to help you in a respiratory manner.<br /><br />It's fall time in Alaska, which means with the change of seasons we're all having sneezing fits up the wazoo. It seemed like the prime time to try out this oil! One morning when my eyes were particularly puffy and my girl's nose was particularly sniffly, I decided to heat some of this oil up and see how well it worked. It took a while to dissipate into my small home, but over the day I did gradually feel better- which is very unique for me. Typically if I start the morning with allergies, they'll progressively get worse throughout the day. On the other hand, with the constant dissipation of this oil into the air- I think it counteracted my allergies and allowed my sinuses to feel better rather than worse.<br /><br />I definitely noticed that my eyes weren't as watery and I could breathe a bit better. My daughter wasn't sneezing as much; which is always a blessing because wiping little noses all day is never a fun activity. Luckily, my family hasn't yet caught a cold or some other respiratory illness since I've had this oil- but when they do, I know I'll be pulling it out (and at that point I'll come back and update my review for the results there). I can say that it definitely had an impact on my ability to breathe during my allergy spell, and overall did seem to soothe my sinuses. I assume this works in a similar way to VIX Vapor Rub- but it's an herbal alternative, which (in my mind) makes it a better alternative.My daughter wasn't sneezing as much; which is always a blessing because wiping little noses all day is never a fun activity.

It fits like a glove! Having never used any sort of sex toy before I was highly impressed with the gentle yet pleasing vibrations this puts off!  I like how this design is sleek and smooth all around without any ridges and hard to clean surfaces, with that being said the extreme thrill is waterproof and easy to clean.<br /><br />When you press and hold the power button you can feel it power on, with a small few seconds vibration. Each button is labeled with the areas you wish to have the vibrator focus on. The 'S' for shaft and the 'R' for rabbit. With the first push of the 'S' button you can instantly feel the double motors pulsating in the center and the tip of the rabbit interchanging between the two areas. With the second push of the same button it does a rhythm vibration with the center and tip only faster than the first setting. The third setting on the 'S' button concentrates more on the tip of the rabbit, it actually moves the top area back and forth. Allowing all areas to be reached. The forth setting has pulsating vibrations up and down the vibrator. The fifth setting which is my favorite, has spurts of vibrations per second. It felt soothing and relaxing. With the 'R' button there are several different settings as well which range from light pulsating to intense and even rhythm vibrations. What I enjoyed was you can either have both of the buttons pushed at the same time and on which ever setting you enjoy or you can take pleasure in using just one button to satisfy your needs.<br /><br />This vibrator is comfortable to use and the way it is formed allows you to be at ease while using. There is a lock photo on the bottom that lets you see which way to turn the bottom to insert the batteries. Really helpful in case you are in a hurry! This is perfect for yourself or if you want to enjoy it with your partner. It really is a fun way to spice up your sexual activities. I likethat this feels sturdy and no worries about taking it into a shower. That is the best thing is that it is waterproof which allows you to branch out on your thrill seeking adventures. This also comes with 3 AAA batteries so you can enjoy as soon as you purchase it!<br /><br />I received this product for free, however that in no way affects my review",2015-08-31

If you do, supporting your liver can help your body keep up with detox rather than get overwhelmed by excess histamine. Some research shows that people who take a milk thistle extract in combination with a conventional antihistamine have reduced symptoms compared to people who just use an antihistamine. I notice a huge reduction in &#34;allergic shiners&#34; (dark circles under the eyes) when using milk thistle to support detox.<br /><br />That's not all it's good for. I recommend it for those who have poor liver function due to prescription medications that are metabolized by the liver. Research also shows it useful to reduce the severity of acid reflux, stomach pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. Additionally, some research shows that taking silymarin, a chemical found in milk thistle, along with conventional treatment can decrease blood sugar, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad”) cholesterol, and triglycerides in people with diabetes.<br /><br />I'm rather picky about the supplements I choose. This was a good choice for my family since we look for good &#34;clean&#34; supplements without a ton of fillers or multiple ingredients due to extensive allergies. This formula is standardized to contain 80% silymarin so you know how much of the good stuff you are actually getting.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.

I love how the BCAAs and glutamine are included (I used to have to add some with my previous proteins so now I never forget!).

After first using this product, twenty minutes or so after taking the supplements I noticed an extremely pleasant sensation.  My mind felt free for the first time, like I had the best nights rest ever, so alive. It's not like a caffeine buzz or anything but a feeling of mental clarity.  I did some research and I believe this is due to the Maca root.  I had to order my partner a bottle because she begged me to try it after hearing me rave about my experiences with it and her having nearly the same reactions to it I did.  It is my understanding that I need to continue taking these supplements each day for awhile to really take advantage of the goat weed as it's not something that works overnight.  After a week or so of use, I have noticed an increase in my sex drive but I'd like to see where things are at after a month of use.  So far I'm really happy with this product and seems my partner is also  but she needs more time with it.  With all the great reviews for this supplement and the initial results, I'm excited to see where things are at in another month.  No regrets so far, the company who makes this seem to want to make sure I'm pleased and so far I am.  This is an early review so I'm very hopeful that things keep getting better.",2015-08-31

In my case, I am developing chronic kidney disease; my kidneys have been degrading since 2008.  Conventional medicine says that kidney function once lost is gone forever.  Dr. Wallach claims that Ultimate Cardio FX can halt kidney degradation and possibly win back kidney function once believed to be irretrievable.<br /><br />I will be testing my kidney function in November 2015; I will update my review then.  I have been using Cardio FX for  one week and thus far, I have no ill effects.  Some people have experienced heart palpitations due to the digitalis-mimicking herbs in Cardio FX.  Others may be allergic to gingkyo extract.  Please be aware of these possible side effects.<br /><br />If the test results are favorable, my rating for Cardio FX will be sky high.<br /><br />Note added Nov. 2015 - my latest blood draw shows improvement in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.  BUN has decreased by 21%, and creatinine shows a 10.1 decrease compared to the previous 2015 levels.  In fact, these  levels are comparable to my 2013 marks.  My nephrologist will await more blood test results for February 2016 before passing judgement on my decision to try Cardio FX.  Variation in test results is fairly common, but favorable results in February will begin a trend towards undeniable improvement.  I hope to give a 5 star rating<br />in February 2016.<br /><br />Note added 1 March 2016 - My latest blood test results have shown that my kidney disease has been STOPPED DEAD IN ITS TRACKS.  I apologize for hollering at you.  You can tell I am very pleased.  My blood tests have never been better since 2009, a year after being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.  Dr. Joel Wallach has given me the fountain of youth; his Cardio FX has reversed seven years of deteriorating blood chemistry.  These results occurred after seven months on Cardio FX.

I've discovered that it is likely due to the insertion and removal of the charger head.  Once I noticed it, I now hold on to the plastic when I am working with the charger cord.  Definitely a design flaw, and back to 3 stars.  Update #2:  I have reinstated the 4 stars, due to excellent customer service today, promising to send a replacement.  Update #1: I can't believe I have to update my review 10 minutes after originally writing it... the entire piece inside the band (where you insert the charger and that holds the display button) has broken off.  Sorry, but I have to remove one of the original 4 stars now.  I've been using this for about 4 months now before writing a review.  I've tried to break down the highlights between the band and the app:  Pros of the band itself: -band is very comfortable, adjustment is easy -easy to clean -heart rate monitoring very accurate -calories expended estimated well from heart rate, age and gender  Cons of the band: -hurts to wear at first, until you get used to it (a couple days) -not waterproof -charging port is behind the face -no battery indicator (you have to create a setting to alert you via email, etc.) -the button that you depress to activate the display recently fell off  Pros of the app: -can set up incoming phone alerts (shows you the number calling) -alarm set up to vibrate the fitbit -tracking walks/runs with GPS, then seeing splits and stats -can receive email summaries and start challenges if you want them  Cons of the app: -when food database does not contain your item, it asks you to send various pictures of UPC, nutrition, etc. but the food never gets added -&#34;Recent&#34; and &#34;Frequent&#34; foods algorithm seems to only work for the first few weeks.  For example, something I ate within the first few days (but never again) shows up in my Recent foods -no way to copya food from a previous day (like MyFitnessPal) -settings don't always stick - for example, Dominant or non-Dominant wrist -workouts will sometimes be duplicated -sleep interpretation should be taken very lightly.... does not do a great job of distinguishing restless vs awake or REM  Overall - a decent product, except the fragility of the button on the band.  While the app is quirky, it still does the job. My main purpose was to get something withan accurate heart rate functionality to calculate my calorie burn, so this is fine for me.",2015-08-31

First, as mentioned in other reviews, the stones are not the shape, type or quality of those pictured.  Second, they are advertised as &#34;engraved&#34; with the chakra symbols, but they actually appear to just be stamped with a low quality paint that is easily scraped off, which brings me to the third point: several of the stones had the paint scraped off and so the symbols were incomplete.  Fourth, the 4th (Heart Chakra) symbol was incorrect - they simply duplicated the symbol from the 7th (Crown Chakra).  I sent an email to the Shambala Shop expressing my concern with the incomplete and incorrect symbols.  They were very polite and prompt in their response and sent me a new set.  Unfortunately, all of the above statements were also true of the second set.  If you truly want a good quality and accurate set of chakra stones, I recommend looking elsewhere.",2015-08-31

The silicone also makes it easy to clean. I also really like the vibration speeds since there are 7 different speeds everyone will be able to find what level they prefer.<br /><br />I really like that this vibrator is chargeable since I don't always have a ton of batteries all the time.

When you get down to it, it's not all that unlike the insertion of an O.B. brand tampon, there is a learning curve you catch fairly quickly. There are many brands and not all of them will be perfect for you or perfect for your &#34;sister&#34; but, like finding the right brand of tampons, you have to experiement. If you have tried another brand of menstrual cup and it wasn't just right, then try these and you may find success. I was glad to find my sample to review was in the success category for me.<br /><br />Silicone is a good choice and I find them really comfortable and they are totally neutral and won't develop an odor. Cleaning them is a breeze with just a bit of hot water and you can sterilze them if you would like. When you are out and if you need to change it, bring along a non clear sealing baggy or small container and just put a bit of tissue in the well, clean later when you are home. It sounds odd but it's a lot better than walking around with stained underwear from leaks with tampons or that super stiff chafed feeling you get when you aren't soaking that hard rayon and cotton thing fast enough.<br /><br />Having a period has it's inconveniences but menstrual cups are right up there for being effective, comfy and economical.",2015-08-31

I was on anti depressants and anti anxiety medication for 10+ years. I didn't like how they made me feel emotionally and physically. I started taking this in July.

Within 2 weeks family members and friends noticed a complete change: I was happier, full of life, and not having panic attacks. I didn't feel helpless anymore and I feel much more in control. After a month of being on it, I feel like I have taken control over my life. Ive been using it for 2 months now and I can sleep regularly now without having problems falling asleep. I can walk outside my house and not feel anxious and be rational when I'm under a lot of stress. The stress doesn't feel as stressful, it just feels like a problem needs to be solved.

This one is our current favorite.  It's very similar to the Tommy Gunn sleeve, except this one is fatter, because the wall between inner and outer diameters is a bit thicker, not like twice as thick, but enough to make a difference.  It's super stretchy, soft and flexible.  I'm about 1.5&#34; wide and it fits me very comfortably.  Lengthwise, like TG, this one comes overly long, and you can easily trim it with a pair of scissors to fit your length.  TG adds about 1.5&#34; length at the tip, but Fat Jack probably adds less than an inch.  This may be disappointing to some, but it's fine for us, since anything longer than about 7.5&#34; is uncomfortable for my wife.  You could probably make this one longer by inserting a properly sized rubber ball at the tip, but if you want LENGTH, try the &#34;3-extra inches sleeve&#34;, which really does add 3 inches.  The thing we love about Fat Jack is that it's THICK.  TG makes me about 2.25&#34; wide; with Fat Jack I'm easily more than 2.5&#34; wide, your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I've read some negative comments about sleeves like this, people saying they're not natural, that they prefer their partner's real penis, and that size doesn't matter.  But I wonder how many of those people enjoy using dildos during their play, that might be larger than the real thing.  If that's the case, then just consider that these sleeves are like a dildo that you manipulate with your own member, using your hips and all that god gave you to pleasure your partner.  And although a normal to small sized penis may be fine, I can tell you that based on my experience, a bigger cock makes a difference.  The looks on my wife's face, the way her cheeks flush, the sounds she makes, the things she says, and especially the bigger, louder and longer orgasms she has, all convince me that size does matter.  And that is just exactly why I lovethese things too, because ultimately I want to give her as much pleasure as possible.<br /><br />Sleeves like this cut down on a lot of the sensation, which can be a good thing for men with hair-trigger issues.  I find that if I put one on with hardly any lube inside, there's very little friction against my penis, although there is a pleasant squeezing feeling from the sleeve, and I can definitely feel pressure from my wife, so under these conditions I could stay hard and go all night.  But if I put plenty of lube inside, then it feels like a masturbation sleeve, and I can get off easily and very pleasurably.<br /><br />One thing I'm not crazy about regarding Fat Jack is its material.  It's not the same as TG, definitely has a chemical smell.  For us it's not perfectly ideal, but we like everything else about it, so still 5 stars.  Like TG it comes with a little paint on the head, which comes off easily if you rub it with a little mineral oil.  Although the smell is a little funky, the material seems very sturdy and resilient, and you can easily turn the thing inside out, which makes putting it on very easy.<br /><br />Small boned young women who've never given birth may be agog at this thing.  Go slow, use plenty of lube, and communicate.  Have fun!",2015-08-31

The comfort shield is a great innovation that not only assists in guiding the razor smoothly across skin but it also emits a gel coating to help keep the skin hydrated if you're in a rush and need a close shave outside of the shower. My skin is silky smooth and I don't have any nicks or razor burn!  The three blades gave me a nice close shave however the only thing I would do to improve the design is to add two more  blades for the closest most comfortable shave on the market. Another feature I really like is the style of the blade gaurd. Just a couple weeks ago I sliced my thumb open removing a blade gaurd on another brands razor because it was designed to lift off and you had to push in the direction of the blades. I love that the BIC Soleil Glow razor has a slide on blade shield that is easy to remove and is removed by pushing to the side. The comfort shield also provides extra protection against cutting yourself while removing the blade shield.  Some things I would like to know before purchasing the product are : is the comfort shield effective, is it a close shave, and is it easy to use. The answer to all three questions is yes!!!  Another feature I like is the width of the handle I happened to have a package of BIC Soleil originals on hand and the BIC Soleil Glow razors have a much wider and more tapered handle which I found makes it a lot simpler to achieve a safe smooth shave quickly , a must as a new mother. Overall I would recommend the BIC Soleil Glow razor to anyone looking for a safe smooth satisfactory shave!",2015-08-31

I've tried the Diva and I've tried the Meluna Classic. The Lena cup is far superior to the Diva, and comparible (but slightly better) to the Meluna Classic.<br /><br />The benefits of the Lena cup is that it's medical grade silicone. It stays in place well, and doesn't leak (I had major issues trying to get my Meluna to not leak). The stem is better than the Diva's (my Meluna didn't have a stem). However, I suggest either leaving the entire stem intact, or removing it entirely. I initially tried it full-length, then tried it with a notch or two cut off (which was MAJORLY uncomfortable), and then removed it entirely. I prefer no stem.<br /><br />The base portion of this cup is firmer than I'm used to, so pinching it for removal is a task, but other than that this is a great cup for a great price!<br /><br />TL;DR: Buy the Lena cup because it is awesome and very functional! :)",2015-08-31

It was easy to set up, easy to put on, touch of a button and it inflates silently and deflates right away, no long drawn out inflation or long wait for it to deflate. It is telling me that I'm holding my wrist too high, but I'm not and I'm not worried about it, because I have the back up from the doc.<br /><br />It's small and came in a nice little black plastic case.

After washing, rinsing, combing, brushing, applying hair products and styling, tons of hair would be wrapped up in my fingers. I tried this shampoo and it my hair actually stopped coming out after using it for a couple of weeks. I've been using it now for about 6 weeks and I have about an inch of new hair growing all over my head, it is not thick, but my scalp isn't showing like it was before, so the hats are no longer necessary.

For this reason, I really was about to throw the Femmycycle in the trash because I couldn't figure out why the heck it would leak no matter what I did to insert it right .<br /><br />I tried all kinds of folds and insertion methods. I even bought both the regular and teen version and nothing. Until I figured out that since my vaginal wall is swollen, there is no space for the femmycyle to open at ALL, because the swollen wall presses on the femmycycle. It will never work for me! This is just my anatomy and there's really nothing I can do about it! And if on top of that my cervix shifts, that makes it even harder! Not to mention that you are totally working in darkness and blind, which makes it impossible for me. It works perfectly the first day because it is not yet swollen, and the last days because the swelling goes down; the rest of the days it doesn't, so it's pointless.<br /><br />Even though I love the idea of using a menstrual cup, i think I will try a different cup; a normal cup that creates a &#34;seal&#34; and hopefully it will work.<br /><br />The Femmycycle is definitely not for me. I hope this review helps at least one person. If you are planning to buy this cup I would suggest examining yourself closely during your period, maybe this doesn't happen to everyone, although both things I have read to be normal so you could be one of the unlucky ones.<br /><br />I still give this cup a 5, because the cup is very well made and I love that it is made of medical silicone so there's no need to boil it.

The school nurse thought I was crazy, but we couldn't be happier. They stay in place very well without sticking to the wound or damaging the surrounding skin. There is a white ish goo that forms, that tended to leak due to the size of the wound vs bandage, and made the nurse very nervous. She thought it looked like infection.  I stuck to my guns, only having to change the bandages a bit more often than expected, and less than a week out, the wound is healing beautifully. When I say we changed them more than expected, I mean every 12 to 24 hours at first rather than every 4-6 hours with more traditional gauze, but less than the 3-5 days my research promised.

I called SC Johnson, got them on the phone, explained all of the information and then had them send me another one. Ugh, this product works when it works, but you’ll never know how long that will be. Unreliable.<br /><br />Update: This is an update to this review that I was really wrote unhappily. With a few hacks, I’m now really satisfied with my scrubbing bubbles cleaner, and have had my second version for nearly a year now. Basically, here’s the biggest problem with this cleaner, they advertise it for daily use when it should be advertised for 3-4 times a week use. This makes the cleaner live far longer than if you use it every day. For me, I started using a homemade after shower spray, and I only need to use the shower cleaner every other day if not less. My homemade shower clean is ultra simple, with just citric acid and water. I use one third of my favorite citric acid brand [[ASIN:B00OV8ST8W Citric Acid Powder - Ultra Fine Pure Powdered Crystals - Natural Preservative Food Grade Quality (16 oz)]] and two thirds water. As soon as I hop out of the shower, I just spray lightly for about five seconds and then go on about my day. Every couple days I then use my automatic shower cleaner, and I lie to you not, I only have to scrub my shower once every 8-10 weeks if I do this. I’m a really neat guy, so I like things clean, but really, doing this method I don’t have to scrub nearly as much as I did before. Now, I’m pretty satisfied with the shower cleaner, and I recommend it.retty satisfied with the shower cleaner, and I recommend it.",2015-08-31

She's also not a fan of the flavors (I didn't see any issue with them, as I taste-tested them after she complained). So for my picky eater, we went back to chewable tabs. But I would recommend this to other families- I thought they tasted pretty good, and they have great food-based nutrition.",2015-08-31

Let me explain my thought process, research and what I like and dislike about the Fitbit Charge HR.<br /><br />I consider myself a fairly active person: I run, bike or lift weights 5-6 days a week. I bought this Fitbit because I wanted to keep track of my steps throughout the day as well as my heart rate. I didn't want anything over complicated or bulky and it had to take the day-to-day abuse in stride. After reading extensively about the Garmin Vivoactive I decided it was a little too much for what I needed. I didn't need the GPS feature because I take my iPhone 6 with me when I run, bike and lift. Also, the Vivoactive had poor reviews with regards to its design and display. The Apple Watch seemed like more of a vanity piece than an actual useful fitness tool. Plus I didn't want to spend $400 on something that didn't even have a GPS option. And the Fitbit Surge was too bulky for daily use, at least for my liking. I purchased the large and it's a great fit for a 5'10&quot;, 190 lb adult male. My friend is similar in size as I am and he bought a small and it's rather tight on his wrist.<br /><br />What I like about the Charge HR:<br />• It's super comfortable. This was a huge necessity for me because I wear it day and night--except during bathing.<br />• The battery life is exceptional. I've used it 5 days without charging it. Mind you, 5 days is what Fitbit claims. Many people have complained online about the battery life. The solution is to turn of &quot;all day sync&quot; on your phone and computer. Just sync it a few times a day.<br />• It's accurate and gets better with time. The more I wear it the more it adjusts to my movements. The heart rate monitor was a little off at first but it's very accurate after two weeks of use. I've compared it to a Polar monitor and it's very close. This thing is perfect for tracking my heart rate while running and biking. Plus it tells my what my resting heart rate is all day and night.<br />• Checking my steps and time on the fly is easy. All I have to do is raise my wrist and it displays my preferred display and the same is true with the tapping feature.<br />• The caller ID feature is great. I don't always have my phone with me at work or home. Having the ability to be notified of a call is super useful.<br />• It charges fast. It takes about 2 hours to charge if it's almost dead. I charge mine little by little each day. I keep the charger in my bathroom and plug it in when I'm in the shower. That way I never worry about it going dead.<br />• The fitness tracking options are nice. I can either use the device to track my runs, the Fitbit app, Endomondo or Strava. There are more but those are my preferred. The other fitness apps sync nicely with Fitbit's.<br />• The Fitbit app is great. I track all of my activity and food. I was using Myfitness pal and LoseIt prior but have now deleted them and solely use Fitbit. I also disconnected my other apps from the Apple Health app. I don't like its UI anyway, Fitbit is much better.<br />• Competitive features. I love being able to connect with friends and family to compete in step challenges. They really do motivate you--it all depends on the other people involved.<br /><br />What I dislike:<br />• This is cliche but the charging cable is short. I connected a USB extension to it so my problem is solved.<br />• I wish I could sync my calendar notifications with it but this is so minor and it will probably be supported with an update eventually.<br />• Limited colors. They are releasing a blue option soon.<br /><br />As you can see, I didn't have much to complain about. I've been wearing this thing 7 days a week and it hasn't bothered me a bit. Just buy one and start moving!d it to a Polar monitor and it's very close. This thing is perfect for tracking my heart rate while running and biking.

Without hesitating, I got on Amazon and picked this one first because of the reviews and second because it has a nice design unlike some of the other diffusers on here. The blue light is a really nice touch but if it's on your nightstand, it will probably be distracting if you're trying to sleep due to it's brightness. I noticed in other reviews people were saying that there is no way to operate the diffuser without the light which is not true at all, one push of the button turns the diffuser on along with the light and another push of the button turns the light off while continuing to run the diffuser. Another feature I really like about this diffuser is that it has an auto shut off once it runs out of water which really helps with the life of the diffuser as well as energy. Overall, this is a great diffuser if you're new to essential oils like me or you're much more advanced. I would recommend this InstaNatural diffuser to anyone.",2015-08-31

I did receive this item for free in order to test the product.<br /><br />This oil comes in a 10ml amber glass bottle. There is a European Dropper Cap included. The product is rated as 100% organic pure therapeutic grade essential oil. The ingredients are Cinnamon, Clove, Eucalyptus, Lemon and Rosemary oils. The product is made by Health Solutions in Scottsdale, AZ.<br /><br />When I first opened this bottle, it smelled like walking into a room of Vicks Vaporub. That is exactly what it smells like. Just like you use Vicks to open your nose when you have a cold, this oil does the same thing. You can pick out the clove scent. I used this oil to dab a drop on my nose before I went to bed and I dabbed it on my  nose before I went to work in the morning.<br /><br />I  had a bad case of Bronchitis back in June and I don't want to repeat it.

It does give me a level of comfort that I would not have without this product. I do not detect any harshness to the smell. No alcohol or chemicals. The smell does not linger long. Once I dab my finger in the oil, I cannot smell it in the air after about one hour. I have to put my finger to my nose to smell it. However, I can smell it if I put my finger to my nose for a good 8 hours.<br /><br />The oil has a very fresh, light and effervescent smell. This would work great in a diffuser. I would highly recommend this product. I was pleasantly surprised and I will purchase it on my own.",2015-08-31

And these already are working way better than the Dr. prescribed pills.<br /><br />Definitely refrigerate them, though, before using, cuz I smushed one trying to open it. Noob problems. I also eat a yogurt high in probiotics from a middle-eastern market nearly every day, drink kombucha as often as i can (not too keen on the sugar in it though, but hey), try to drink lots of lemon-water and eat ginger as often as I can. None of this has worked exceedingly well on its own, but has helped to maintain it from getting too bad. Today, though, I also just bought goat-milk keifer,  AND garlic pills to take while i'm on my period (garlic cloves and DivaCups don't quite work well together).<br /><br />So far, I'm super satisfied with the relief these are giving me.

I bought more as a &#34;fancy milk thistle extract + fillers&#34; supplement than actually as a green tea supplement. Milk thistle extract is one of the main ingredients in most liver cleaning or detox supplements. I am certainly say this product does help promote regular bowel movements and probably help boost your immune system. Around 80 mg of natural caffeine from the matcha green tea and yerba mate is present in each serving to give you a boost of energy as well. At 1 dollar per serving for a month supply it is similarly priced compared to other popular liver supplements which are usually 23 to 30 dollars for a month supply. The main difference between this and most other liver supplements is this is a powder as opposed to capsules and this does goes with caffeine inside. Those who are just looking for a green tea supplement can certainly find better quality certified organic green tea for much less and those who want the VERY BEST (from an ingredients standpoint) liver supplement can also find better, though in that vein this is a good quality product. The tea aspect of this product should be thought of as just an alternative to capsules this really is just a quality liver support supplement that happens to contain some caffeine and its drink flavor is matcha green tea.",2015-08-31

There is an instruction booklet that explains the results, which are basically the same type of reading that you would see on a pregnancy test. However, there was one major downside of this test for me. Almost all of the lines came through in different shades.

By Christina Moss Naturals.",Health & Personal Care,5,0,1,N,Y,Great for skin suffering from adult acne and dryness caused by benzoyl peroxide,"UPDATE:<br />I eventually went to a dermatologist and got a prescription which healed my acne. Since then I have tried other moisturizers and BB creams because I still do not love the smell of this stuff. But after using other products for a few months I stumbled across my old tub of this and used it again one night. It felt so wonderful and my skin looked so plump and smooth and hydrated the next morning. I still haven't found a moisturizer that my skin loves as much as this stuff. And if I use this with [[ASIN:B00FYI6VCO E.l.f. Acne Fighting Foundation Ivory, 1.21 Fluid Ounce]] it looks like I'm not wearing makeup at all and just have perfectly smooth clear skin. I cannot recommend this moisturizer enough.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I have been battling an awful attack of adult acne. I looked like my face had been drug across gravel. It was so red and swollen it almost looked like an open wound. I've been using benzoyl peroxide which has been helping A LOT. However it makes me look like a reptile shedding its skin. Given the choice between looking like a mummy from the crypt or having swollen red painful clusters of cysts I'd choose the mummy. But I didn't want to just give up and accept my flaky fate. My regular moisturizer wasn't doing much to help with the dryness. I tried a few others but some were super heavy and oily, others did nothing, some moisturized but aggravated the acne. This has been the best I've found so far!<br /><br />While the lotion is nice and light it does leave a slightly oily sheen on my face which isn't optimal. But if I use a setting powder on top of my makeup it helps soak up the excess oil (although later in the day I start to look oily again). I also found that if I apply this first then the benzoyl peroxide cream it isn't quite as drying, but still fights the acne. I know everyone says to do the benzoyl peroxide cream first, but after months of doing it that way then months of doing it my way, I think putting the moisturizer on first is not only fine but preferable for my skin.<br /><br />This smells like licorice or anise. At first I hated that but now I'm used to it... and even kind of like it now. The packaging made me think it would smell like lavender. Just a head's up, it doesn't! And while I'm OK with the smell.... I'd still prefer a different scent. The scent does wear away pretty quickly. As soon as I'm done getting ready in the morning the scent has already worn off. Also, scent isn't as important as the healing properties.<br /><br />So the pros are that it really helps moisturize my poor acne-laden skin and is nice and light and feels really good and is quite healing. The downsides are the slightly oily sheen left after massaging it in, and the smell isn't ideal. Overall, the pros DEFINITELY outweigh the cons. I can deal with an oily look and temporary scent to get the benefits of having a moisturized healed face.eferable for my skin.  This smells like licorice or anise.

I ran out of my usual detergent and picked up the Target brand dishwasher detergent (I think it's called Up & Up?) while shopping for my kids' school clothes. BIG mistake. I always put essentially clean dishes in my 1.5 year old Bosch dishwasher--I rinse and scrape down the dishes pretty well before they go in--but the Target detergent caused them to come out slightly sticky and covered in water stains, and I'd have to hand wash them AGAIN. After 2 weeks of this nonsense, I threw away the rest of the Target detergent and switched back to my usual brand (Cascade), but the results were the same for the next week. I was convinced that awful detergent ruined my dishwasher. After reading a ton of reviews on the Finish and Jet Dry Dishwasher Cleaner product, I figured I'd give it the old college try and hope for the best.<br /><br />Wow. Just... wow. It's like a new dishwasher. I'm throwing caution to the wind and not even scraping all the cheese off my plates and they're coming out sparkling clean.

I purchased to use to weigh for athletic competition where we have to make specific weight classes.  The scale I got was nearly two pounds off my actual weight, as measured by a certified scale.

Finally when I put on jeans, the scale showed I weighed two pounds more.  In short, it is completely insensitive to small changes in weight and thus useless for my purposes.<br /><br />I had hoped that this scale would be better than my fifteen year old model that is on the verge of dying, but still gives accurate readings.

He has a tendency to bite through the plastic sippy spout's and I figured since they were compatible with Avent nipples that this would fit. It does fit, the only issue I have is that the location of the air release in the hard sippy spouts leaks if there is extra milk and your child does not drink it completely. This in turn would be a great sippy spout if the opening were closer to the center, instead of right along the closing ring. It's a great spout for regular Avent bottles, the only reason I don't use them is because plastic begins to have a gross milk smell after every use and the taste of water in them is tinged with it, even after sterilizing/boiling. I would use the glass Avent but they are too heavy and expensive not to mention how a sleeve is sold separate but completely necessary for toddler's safely when using.

The packaging is excellent, with no compromises and straightforward labeling. The bag I got also has an expiration date of May 20, 2016 so I should be able to use it all by then. It is important to take into account when ordering large quantities from bulk companies that the expiration dates are often quite close to when you will receive them, so the most efficient way to utilize them would probably be to share them with others if possible.<br /><br />The main thing I have noted about this product is it has quite a strong bitter taste to it, comparable to the powdered caffeine I have tried. For this reason it is best either packed into capsules or mixed in with some kind of strong citrus drink for quick consumption, not mixed in with something you plan to consume at a leisurely pace.<br /><br />While I cannot speak to its effectiveness as of yet (my homemade preworkout cocktail contains a laundry list of various suppliments, all from Bulk Suppliments) I have thus far not seen anything to make me question its quality. Four stars simply because I cannot be entirely certain what its effect is, if any, due to my method of taking it.",2015-08-31

I also have owned several very expensive air purifiers. Here's what I like about this one:<br /><br />This is an improvement over the older large unit that we own in that it's very quiet, takes up a little less space, and is sleeker looking.<br /><br />- One of the things I like about GermGuardian is that it has they UV-C light that kills airborne  mold spores, viruses, bacteria and germs. We live in Florida and the air here is humid, so there are a lot of mold spores in the air. I feel this really helps. It's also great when one of us is sick. I feel it can help cut down on the transmission of a virus or infection in the home. It also removes dust, dirt, smoke, etc. We get the occasional everglades fire out here in the dry season and it gets smokey, so that will be very helpful.<br /><br />- The 3 speeds are great. The lowest speed is ultra quiet, and we use that speed at night.<br /><br />- The UV light can be turned off at night so the unit doesn't give off any light.<br /><br />- There's a little light that will go on when the HEPA filter needs to be replaced. That's very convenient. It's also great that there's only one filter that needs replacing, and that's only needed every 6-8 months approximately.<br /><br />- The charcoal filter removes household odors well. The only issue with this unit, and the reason why I've given it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it's still giving off a very mild smell which I think is from the charcoal, even after using it for a couple weeks. I suspect this will diminish further over time.<br /><br />So I'm happy with this unit and would recommend it. It's an effective air purifier for the price.",2015-08-31

Stevia is a very healthy and great tasting alternative and natural sweetener but extremely hard to find in current products and if the so-called health food companies would just use it, then it could be called healthy.

I used a SnoreClock app on my phone to record noise all night to see if there was any snoring. This generic is based on the Aveo TSD design, and it was the clear winner. It resulted in zero snoring all night. The 'bulb' section is big enough to hold a decent amount of your tongue forward, and it's easy enough to customize how much by choosing how much vacuum to use. The bulb provides suction at many levels, depending how much it's squeezed, but even the lightest is enough to prevent pop-offs over the night, so you can find a comfortable amount to use. The 'flange' that goes across your teeth is well sized and comfortable between the teeth and lips. The 'V' groove goes under the tongue to accommodate the tongue web. In the morning, there might be some minor swelling of the tongue depending on the amount of vacuum, but it subsides very quickly. To release the suction, you press on the sides of the bulb. My only recommendation is to take it out of your mouth over a sink instead of your pillow for drool control.<br /><br />Please note: TSDs will only work for mouth/tongue snorers, not nasal snorers, and it won't help obstructive sleep apnea.

The control works, but it is small and could get lost if one is not careful.  The capacity for sound is limited.  Also the cables to connect the speakers were flimsy and not working properly.  Overall very disappointed with this purchase.  I contacted amazon for return and found out that we are responsible for shipping costs with this seller. I Found out the cheapest UPS ground services to be after packaging close to $30.00! This is crazy to have to pay this for a defective product.

New design Backup External Battery Pack and Charger (Power Bank) with flashlight,Mobile_Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,A Very Good Flashlight & Lightweight Charger,"I bought this primarily to be used as a flashlight and it has worked out well over the last five weeks. I've run it for twenty hours continuously before deciding it was starting to dim. The nice thing about LEDs is the light stays white unlike a filament-type bulb. The light from this device is more than adequate when I'm out on a dark night. Then my phone charger replenishes it once it runs down. The flashlight switch does stick up just a little bit so it is possible for it to be inadvertently switched on (push-on/push-off) while in a pocket or pack.<br /><br />For recharging purposes, the battery capacity in this device is small. Although the battery capacity is spec'd at 2600 MaH, you will never get that amount into the device you are charging. The process of up-converting the charger's battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) to the USB standard (5 vdc) and back down to battery voltage (~3.7 vdc) in the device being charged results in some losses. A good budgetary figure is to plan on transferring 70% of the source battery capacity into the device being charged. So if your phone's battery is spec'd at 2500 MaH, you will need at least a 3600MaH battery in your charger to fully charge the phone's battery. This is true for all battery-driven chargers, not just this one. Or you can shop for a charger whose battery capacity is 150% of the device you need to fully charge - it's that simple.",2015-08-31

In most cases, we get what we expect.  I was skeptical in purchasing these and saw mixed reviews, but these guys claim to be &#34;Apple MFI Certified&#34; and are &#34;genuine&#34;.  Well...BUYER BEWARE!<br /><br />I purchases these in early July, one for each vehicle so we can keep our phones charged.  I bought them when I did because we were going to take a family trip and I wanted to have something in the car to keep devices charged on the go.  I received these two days before we left, but really didn't get to use them until the trip.  Then, just two days in to the trip, the pins on both sides turned black and the cable STOPPED working.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but other cables I've used in the same way (especially the one that came with my iPhone 5c) have worked WITHOUT ISSUE.  Needless to say, just two days in to our trip and we are down a cable, I was more than a bit peeved.<br /><br />If you purchase these from this seller, it is at your own risk and will be a complete gamble.  I highly recommend to keep looking and steer clear of these guys.  The worst part now, is that I have passed the one month window to return these because once back from my trip, I've had to deal with some work emergencies.  So I've basically just wasted my hard earned money on garbage, with no more option for refund.",2015-08-30

The video is clear and the mirror is fairly easy to install.  It has lots of features such as long battery life, motion sensor video mode, gps hook up (if you have your own) and plenty of options.  There are some issues though: (1) if you already have a large rear view mirror the placement of the camera lens may not allow you to position it correctly in your case; (2) the power cord is a bit shorter than other mirror cams that I own - barely reaches around the edges of my 07 Equinox; (3) basically no manual - and any English is a bit difficult to get - requires about 30 minutes of hunting and pecking through the menu and you will find it has lots of features;  (4) the screen is brighter than most but the coating on the reflective surface is a slightly different color than the screen really take some getting used if you look into your mirrors often; (5) has a super bright LED that blinks every other second.  During the night it lightens up my whole SUV - I put a sticker over it now it seems.  I have hooked up the included rear view cam, but looks pretty standard.

That's okay because I'm putting this in my old Chevy pickup and if it gets stolen some day I didn't want to be out a bunch of money. The camera works. Now, here's my only complaint so far - this is quite possibly the most unbelievably bad manual I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad it's actually funny. The camera has three modes: video (called &#34;shooting&#34;), photos, and File management (playback). Got it, not a big deal. Now for the recording video there are a couple options that would be nice to control - like auto shake and auto night mode. Here's what the manual says, &#34;The camera start to record automatic when it is open up, press OK key to stop recording which pressed again to restart recording, press up and down key in recording model to save electricity Press up and down key in recording model for mode switch in day and night, night scene is open fill-in light.&#34; Yeah. That's typed verbatim. So, the up and down key &#34;save electricity&#34; and &#34;mode switch in day and night&#34; in &#34;recording model&#34;. Despite trying about a dozen things, all I can get the up and down keys to do are zoom in and out the camera. That was starting to get kind of frustrating because the fill lights were staying on and there was no way to turn them off or convince the camera to go out of night mode. Finally I resorted to a system reset which quite helpfully switched all the menus to Chinese and (amazingly) turned off the the night mode and associated fill light. Yay. There is also a G sensor (maybe that's the anti-shake?) that ambiguously offers me 2G, 4G, 8G, and OFF. I tried 2G and OFF in the hopes that it would reduce the number of times I thought, &#34;Gee, I have no idea how this option is supposed to work&#34; but alas, my &#34;Gee&#34; count continued to rise. Motion detection? Okay.....well, that's nice, but since it's in a car won't there almost always be motion? I was happy though to find out that &#34;You can press reset and starting up the product when a crash happened because disoperation, it will get right.&#34; Thank goodness! I hate it when I crash my car and it disoperates, but with a push of a button it will get right!",2015-08-28

Part of me likes knowing but the problem is that when I'm in another part of my house and coming in and out of range there is an odd male voice upstairs scaring my kids.  Well. maybe just freaking them out a little.  I bought this, in part, because the NFC should let me connect when I'm in the room and disconnect when I walk out.

From that moment forward, I realized that I needed a dependable recorder and began searching several local consumer outlet stores for this product.  After a couple of weeks without having any success at locating such an antiquated device, I turned to Amazon.com.  To my amazement, this iconic store offered an assortment of cassette player/recorders at affordable prices.  Within five days after ordering a portable recorder, I obtained what I thought was a compatible replacement for my old Panasonic.  However, to my dismay, I found issues with the replacement recorder's volume control and built-in microphone and had to return the item.  When I resumed my search for a dependable cassette player/recorder that functioned as advertised, I was fortunate to find the Jensen product offered by Todays Concept.  This portable cassette player/recorder is worth every penny I spent.  It is compact, lightweight and easy to operate.  The record/play/rewind/fast fwd/stop/eject and pause buttons do not stick when pressed, which is a plus for baby boomers like me who suffer with arthritic stiff fingers.  Although the recorder's built-in condenser microphone functions adequately, for acute clarity of sound I recommend using the external microphone with stand that is included with the recorder.  I assure you, this small microphone is powerful enough to record your inner thoughts, if you are so inclined to articulate them.  I rate this product as 4 and one half stars.",2015-08-28

Not very loud, however, as such things go.  At max, a moderate listening level.<br /><br />Fit/Build profile:  Has rubber feet for vertical positioning, yet plays well horizontally - just be aware that also covers the funky, oddball, what-on-earth Volume, Track AND Power all on a single hybrid slide dial & push button thing that did indeed befuddle me for a few minutes.  All the instructions say is \\""Turn It On\\"".  Great.  It wasn't until I was fooling with that tiny little thing and happen to press against it that I realized you are supposed to long press it in (like a good three seconds at least) to turn it on/off.  And its a pretty tiny slot, not to mention I can see beefy fingers (like one brothers) having a frustrating grapple with it.  This is my main hit.<br /><br />Bluetooth Signal Reception Strength:  On par, through major obstructions, such as walls.<br /><br />Battery Life: It does not disclose an official battery life, even in the instructions.  However, it disclose the use of a 1050mAh battery, so I would estimate 6-8 hours continual play, depending on volume.  This is average for this size of speaker, so neither good nor bad.<br /><br />Additional Observations:  Upper ring around that huge Play/Pause/Answer button (makes that tiny gnome-designed thing on the bottom even smaller in comparison) is a soft, blinking blue when in use.  Turns red while charging, and the red does turn off when full.  Does show the battery life meter on my iPhone 4 (iOS 7.1).  Nice mesh carrying case.<br /><br />Summary:<br />So it had the audio goods, and I like the overall form factor of it.  Just a) not a crunking volume, and b) surely a more standard method of powering, volume, and track selection could have been used...<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.efully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",2015-08-27

I don't listen at max volume and got around 3-4 hours off a charge.<br />  The charging speed depends on the charger you use (it has nothing to do with the cable).  It charges in an hour or 2 with my nice 2 amp charger and takes much longer plugged into a laptop or standard phone charger.  This is standard for any device being charged by USB so don't blame the speaker if it takes forever to charge.<br />  The sound quality is decent.  Not a lot of bass but it's much better than the speakers that come on your cellphone and a lot louder as well.<br />  The suction cup on mine was awesome.  I stuck it to my windshield in the south Georgia heat for more than 2 weeks and it didn't fall off. (my car radio doesn't have bluetooth and I was listening to Pandora on a road trip)<br />  The volume level changes in small increments.  I have had other bluetooth audio devices that increment in large steps so you go from not quite loud enough to way too loud.  This one has small steps so it's easy to find the right audio level.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />  Definitely not &#34;Waterproof&#34; more like &#34;Water Resistant.&#34;  I purchased this for music while Kayaking.  It got splashed a little and didn't seem adversely affected, but it got dunked and started acting weird.  It kept powering on and off again.  The buttons are actually part of a rubber ring that goes all the way around the speaker.  I pulled the ring off and let it air dry and it works good as new.  It's worth the then bucks I paid but they should really change the description.<br />  The volume and track change buttons are the same buttons.  Long press for volume, short press to change tracks.  This can get annoying if you forget and tap the button trying to bump the volume up a bit (as happened to me frequently)",2015-08-27

Gym perfection.,"Fantastic device. I use this everyday. They have much improved the sound quality since the earlier days of Beats, and it is a godsend at the gym not having to deal with wires.<br /><br />----Pros---<br />-Easy Bluetooth connectivity: All you have to do is turn it on and it will automatically connect to the device that you last used with it, provided it is in range. If not, it will default back to any previously paired devices<br />-Great sound: while not as HQ as some of my more audiophile headphones, this is more than listenable, especially for Rap and EDM, music with a heavy bass element that is perfect for the gym<br />-Micro USB plug for charging: This is an absolute must, and huge upgrade over previous models that used AAA batteries.<br />-Build quality: solid build quality. I sweat into them regularly at the gym and it seem to have no effect on the audio quality or the headsets reliability (I bought the 3 year square trade warranty just in case though).  The phones themselves are made of some kind of plastic, but it feels solid and durable.<br /><br />---Cons---<br />-Could use a little more range: sometimes I find myself losing connection momentarily or music stuttering when running to the other basket on a basketball court, when my phone is sitting under the opposite hoop<br />-Battery life: while the battery life is admirable for the package you get, it would be a lot more convenient if the battery life was up to par with a device like the LG Tones. I do love the Micro USB plug for charging though.<br />-Pricey: this is a bit pricey, but I feel the cost is worth it for how well the package you receive works. But thats my opinion and I know some people do not share it. Because of the price I recommend purchasing some kind of Square trade warranty. I bought a 3 year one, just in case my sweating at the gym eventually kills it.",2015-08-27

As you change channels, it speaks the channel you just selected. That is very useful and makes things much easy,<br />-  Very durable, light weight and comfortable to hold.<br />-  Power-saving features to extend battery life.<br />-  Features Include CTCSS/DCS function, Scanning function, Emergency alarm, VOX, TOT and Monitor Functions.<br />-  They are also programmable through PC.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping:  The radios came very nicely packaged in the box which contain: Two radios, Two antenna, Two Li-ion battery pack, Two charger, Two  belt clips, Two slings and User's manual. The shipping was also very fast, i got the BaoFeng radio in two days after placing the order. The price is very reasonable for such a great quality. Luckily i bought them at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review. I am glad that i did because these BaoFeng radios are very well build, light weight and operationally, they perform quite well. I definitely recommend this Baofeng BF-888s Two Way Radio.

They don't come with a microSD card but the generic one I got from Wal-Mart is working perfectly. Navigating between the radio and the player is easy and well explained in the directions. The volume is the best (or worst if you have a kid who loves to blast their drums out) part. when you turn the radio up to max volume, you can hear it fine even from your lap. I love that the radio finds all the presets for you as your move from one area to the next. It found all the available stations in MI, then in CO when we went and then in AZ so my son could enjoy the radio even before we were able to load up his microSD with songs.<br /><br />Just make sure your young ones protect their ears when listening to the radio and MP3 player because the volume gets pretty loud. As headphones they aren't as loud, at least I never heard them when he was using them to play on the android tablet or his handheld thingamajig...Sega I think it is?<br /><br />I love that it functions well as ear phones and as an mp3 player and as a radio. Usually multipurpose devices sacrifice quality for the convenience of an all in one but that is not the case here. Not to mention that it's foldable and the cord detaches so the cord itself can essentially double to attach the earphones to say your car's speaker so that what's on the SD card can be heard by everyone. VERY COOL!",2015-08-24

E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features,"I ordered this E-Prance Dash cam back in May to replace my crappy old standard definition with no useful features. On paper this one looked great and had all the features I wanted. Super wide angle lens, GPS tracking, Speed tracking, super high definition, etc. Overall I've been very pleased with it but it has one major flaw that is simply irredeemable and prevents a 5 star rating. That flaw is it's stupid patented GPS suction-cup mount. At first I was willing to overlook this minor annoyance but after a few months it's proved to be a royal pain in the butt. What ends up happening is over time it gets loose, this is especially true if you move the dash cam from one vehicle to another a few times or simply adjust the angle (not a lot, I've only moved it about 6 times).  What this means is that when you go over a few bumps in the road or around a corner to fast the entire camera unit moves. That perfect camera angle you spend 10 minutes setting up is lost. This wouldn't be a big deal if it used a standard suction cup mount where you can adjust the tightness of the swivel and the up and down motion. Not the case with their suction cup mount, there is no adjustment. You have literally no way to lock the camera into position. Lets say I wanted to for whatever reason point the camera out my windshield facing the sky, I can't do that because the mount is so loose and it will quickly fall into a lower position facing my dashboard.<br />I'd originally overlooked what now seems like an obvious feature to have in such a pricey dash camera... I'm super pleased with everything else this camera does and has to offer but.... I don't know, I guess I'll just continue taking great HD video of my dashboard and a few feet in front of where I'm driving.",2015-08-22

The sound quality is horrible.,"I want to first start out by saying that I received this product at a discount in return for an honest review of the product.  With that said, even at a discount, this speaker is not worth it, allow me to tell you why.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 1 Star<br />Since Sound Quality is obviously the most important part of a bluetooth speaker, I figured I'd start my review by talking about how awful the sound quality is on this speaker.  You can only really turn the volume up halfway before the speaker starts distorting.  Not only that, but if the speaker is at full volume, the vocals are almost not audible because of so much distortion.  Just based off of the Sound Quality portion of my review, I would say definitely do not purchase this speaker.  It was not the discounted price, and it definitely is not worth the full price.<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY - 3 Stars<br />The Build Quality was middle of the road.  Nothing to immediately complain about, nothing to write home about either.  The Design itself is edgy and modern which is nice.  The usb and 3.5m jacks feel solid enough.<br /><br />BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY - 3 Stars<br />The Bluetooth connectivity is very mediocre.  It started disconnecting at 25 feet when I walked just outside of my house.  It's good if you keep it near by.<br /><br />OVERALL - 1 Star<br />This bluetooth speaker is not worth it's $40 price tag.  It's also not worth the discounted price I got it for.  And it's all because of how poor the actual sound quality is.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this speaker.",2015-08-22

And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

The item arrived quite quickly which was great however this is the only positive thing i can really say about this. I gave the MP3 player plenty of charge so it would last for around 6hours of constant use. I took the mp3 to work the next day and the device only worked for around two hours as the battery life had depleted. I immediately put this item on charge after use as i thought it might not have charged correctly, however after trying it the next day i powered up the device and straight away it turned itself off after a few moments. I have also noticed that the centre button is not working at all. Really disappointed with this item and i would highly recommend to anyone considering this as a purchase to look elsewhere and spend a little bit more cash or find another device as this item is really rubbish and really not worth wasting 20 dollars and now i have an item that no doesn't work.",2015-08-19

I know how expensive it can get to have it added as a feature in your car if you are to go to a service center. Now my wish is granted, I have this camera in our car with decent price. If you are not inclined with wirings and stuff in the car it will be hard for you to install this. We installed it to where when you put the car in reverse, the monitor will turn on and this will give the view. My husband really likes this! It gives a good view at the back and keeps everyone safe when backing up. It works well at night too. If only I knew that putting a rear camera isn't that costly I would have done it long time ago. We haven't tested it under rainy condition since it hasn't been raining in California lately. But I will definitely give you an update after we tried that.

I personally do not drive down the freeway or down the street in reverse so I only needed this camera for when I back up in a parking lot or parking in reverse which I do maybe 2 to 4 times a day and it usually takes me 5 seconds to 10 seconds max. I was just looking for a camera to make sure I don't hit a shopping cart, a kid, another persons car or a person in a bike cus we all know they never lookout for themselves. Overall the camera serves it's purpose which is what I was looking for, a rear-view camera at an affordable price. I wasn't expecting full H-D when I ordered this and don't need it for something that I may spend a total of 40 seconds a day looking at ,if that. The quality of the camera is good during the day and at night it's pretty good too, I have LED lights for my reverse lights so that does help. I also liked that it had a little grid so I know where I'm going. The camera came with a drill bit to drill the perfect size hole in my car which I really appreciated, it also came with the needed power cable and video cable. For me it was really easy to install since I have installed stereos and monitor in my cars in the past and also have installed audio and video in my home so it took less then 30 minutes and that's only because I'm the type of person that likes to have a nice professional looking install and don't like having wires all over the place.

DON'T BUY,"This has the potential to be a great inexpensive dashcam, but two flaws are ruining it for me:<br />1. Despite what the product pictures show, the camera has a BRIGHT silver lens barrel, not the more subtle black one show in the pics. This would be a minor cosmetic issue, except for the fact that the silver barrel makes this SUPER OBVIOUS if you leave it mounted to your windshield when your car is parked. It's like the damn thing was designed to be enticing to thieves. I contacted Amazon about this and they sent me a second one, which (despite the pics on the site and the product box) also sports the bright silver color. Annoying, but fixable with a Sharpie and some time.<br />2. The dashcam broke within a couple weeks of installing it. It works for about 3 minutes before powering off completely, and refuses to power up again until the power cord is completely disconnected and re-inserted (hardly safe while driving). I've heard good things from trusted sources about this camera so I'm hoping this is just a fluke and hopefully the soon-to-be-received replacement will be awesome, but this early and sudden failure (coupled with the issue noted above) doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.<br /><br />**UPDATE**  Wanted to provide an update. About ~15 months after purchasing the original and then getting the replacement because the 1st one was DOA, the second camera is broken. It powers on and I can &#34;use&#34; it as you'd expect, but it no longer records reliably to memory cards (I've tried with different known-good cards formatted in-camera). Super frustrating to find out that it stopped recording files to the card months ago, despite all the icons on the LCD display indicating everything is working fine. Naturally it is just outside the manufacturers warranty now, so I've got an $89 paperweight. I strongly encourage you to skip this camera and buy something else - this one is junk. :-(",2015-08-17

Im glad that this unit is so clear.<br />-You can play DVD's.....<br /><br />That's as far as I can go with the standouts.<br /><br />The issue i have for this is that, I cant really imagine many people using the DVD feature anymore, considering DVD or any kind of CD device is outdated technology, especially if you have a smart phone that you are connecting to this device. I bought this unit thinking I might be able to play youtube, and other video files on the screen. ONCE AGAIN PLAYING VIDEO/MEDIA FILES FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE CANNOT BE DONE WITH THIS UNIT! I have to capslock that statement in case people are thinking that this 2015 model unit would have that feature.<br /><br />In my defense I searched the pioneer's main website prior to purchasing to get some more details about this product. It had a little ad that showed the phone app that you can download to use with pioneer headunits. I mistakenly took that ad as a feature for this specific unit. That app does not work for this unit, unless someone can show me otherwise.<br /><br />Hope this helps a few of you guys.",2015-08-17

I use it with my laptop, my iphone, my ipad...it doesn't need to be plugged in (it charges when it is plugged into the laptop) and it was SOOOOO easy to connect.  I literally am the worst techy person (I don't have any music on my phone because I don't know how to get it on there!) and even I got the bluetooth to work.  I can listen to &#34;The Moth&#34; from my iphone or watch a movie on my laptop and actually hear what is going on.  I have other speakers that I bought through Amazon as well and I loved those.  But, what I like specifically about this is that it is bluetooth and it doesn't have to be plugged in. And the other speakers I can't use with my ipad or iphone.  I can actually listen to my iphone in the car.  And when my phone rings, it stops what I was listening to until I am done talking.",2015-08-17

Some lasted 3 days: none served me for more than a month before breaking.  And most cost at least twice as much as this gold all-metal BT speaker that looks like the interchangeable lens for an SLR camera.<br /><br />In short, this is the only non-brand, inexpensive BT speaker that I could recommend and that I might give as a gift.  The audio quality is loud enough and decent for a speaker of this size, and the speaker has proven durable, lasting me for an entire year.<br /><br />Of course, there are a few caveats: You should not expect to hear much bass (or, for that matter, anything close to full-frequency sound).  Also, any reference to an FM radio is unlikely to have any relevance in the West, where all you're likely to receive is static.  Finally, my &#34;pre-2014&#34; version of this speaker charges with a &#34;mini SD&#34; connector (commonly used to transfer images from a digital camera to computer) instead of the more common &#34;micro SD&#34; connector.",2015-08-17

While part of it has to do with one being valued at almost triple the other- the majority of my reasoning is in the strengths one device has over the other. And yes, even in a much lower end device you are bound to find applications more suited to a $100 speaker than a $300 one. While one may deliver crisp expansive audio, the other may have a significantly longer battery standby life, for example.<br /><br />Primarily, for us, this bluetooth speaker has an appeal in the range of features it boasted at such an expendable price point. No one wants to hear their product is 'expendable,' but our brand loyalty to Sentey comes mostly from their execution of easy to use, functional, gaming products under a $50 price point. The convenience of Bluetooth devices lie in the portability of the product, and the vary nature of being portable puts a tech device in harms way from circumstances such as theft, water damage, and improper use (especially if your devices are used in communal circumstances.) While I would love to take my Infinity One to work at the marina and in the golf cart, my paycheck can't afford any mishaps around water or sticky hands from teenage skateboarders. In that case, I desire portable audio that is quick to setup, long lasting in life, and durable in design- with a price point under $50- so here we are testing the Sentey Bluetooth 4.0:<br /><br />Yays:<br /><br />*We always start with packaging- This speaker looks like it could have just come off Best Buy's shelf- It was packaged in a sturdy box inside an outer packaging sleeve. Not only did the box seem like it could withstand shipping and even continual storage, it was colorful and informative, something you don't often see in a value tech brand.<br /><br />*The design is very attractive- many 'bargain' bluetooth speakers come in bright gaudy colors that look and feel cheap- or targeted towards tweens. The slick black facing and 360 speaker design is very modern and style friendly for any geographic or setting. I love how the buttons on the top are inlaid under the rubber coated material so the speaker's operation is quite intuitive and seamless. While this speaker is not waterproof in a sense it could fall into water, the buttons on the top are all beneath the facing, so one could handle it with damp or wet hands without worry (this would be great in a kitchen when working on a recipe.)<br /><br />*This speaker includes a complimentary carry case, which you will want to use because the rubberized top and bottom coating seems to scuff easily. The case fits a little snug and has a drawstring close.<br /><br />*A big plus for me was the ability to play while plugged in- and the device even seemed to maintain or gain a charge while playing and charging. This mainly means I can use it as a stationary speaker in my office for an entire day without having to fuss with it.<br /><br />*Bluetooth pairing was quick, my devices located it on the first scan and there was no searching or fancy button configurations- simply turn it on and put your streaming device in Bluetooth discovery mode.<br /><br />*The product advertises up to 33 feet of connection thanks to Bluetooth 4.0 technology. This is a direct line of path claim- with minor obstructions such as furniture and a dresser, we maintained about a 15 foot connectivity. I COULD keep connectivity through the wall but this was a pretty direct proximity, best estimated at 8 to no more than 10 feet. When outside with no obstructions we successfully measured 30 feet of crisp, uninterrupted transmission.<br /><br />*I like that there is a direct on/off switch so there is never confusion about whether the speaker is on or off- this helps save battery life.<br /><br />*Speaking of battery life- This DOES have exceptional battery life for the value and clarity. On a full charge of Bluetooth wireless radio app streaming we've clocked 7 hours and 50 minutes play time.<br /><br />*The sound is stereo with 2 5 watt drivers for 10 watts total at about 125-250hz audio output. The bass on this speaker is fairly impressive for the price and size but not the same caliber as high output speakers you'd find over $200. In general, this speaker does beautifully with layered audio and instrumental heavy tracks- vocals can sound a little tinny at times (illustrated on the devices bluetooth calling feature) but in general what this device lacks in precision clarity (and don't get me wrong, it's great audio for the price range) it makes up in volume. Oh so very much volume. I can fill an entire veranda or pool deck with the output from this single portable speaker.<br /><br />Mehs:<br /><br />*While it seemed to turn 'on' out of the box, it would not pair- This is because it had no prior or residual charge. In general it's a pet peeve of mine when electronics don't include batteries, or a partial charge. No one wants to open a gift and have to wait hours to play with it.<br /><br />*Charge time from empty to full was long for a device of this size and output- it took nearly 3 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) to charge out of the box.<br /><br />*The upper and bottom material is a rubberized grip that is soft and slick but seems to scuff very easy.<br /><br />*The included cables aren't the highest quality or length. If you are an audiophile you likely have better quality cabled laying around- the charging cable, in particular fit a little snug for my liking. We use our own cables for aux and charging.<br /><br />*This claims to deliver big sound without the bulk- I feel it is one of the more bulky bluetooth speakers I own, especially for amp and bass output. Bulky can be a good thing, especially when you plan on using the speaker outdoors ad in social stations often. Bulky, in this case, also means it has weight in the hand and feels like it is built well- however, it certainly is not a dainty speaker.<br /><br />*It's hard to determine when you are done charging the speaker, and there's no real way to know how many hours or what percentage of battery life you have left. A visual queue or different colored light/patterns would be nice.<br /><br />In summary, this product performs at a believable range for it's list price of $69, and we've found it a great deal for the current asking price of $34 with prime. I like that this speaker has more of a presence than some of other other 'micro and portable bluetooth audio options and feel confident enough in the product that I would gift one to any casual to moderate music lover. I received a product discount in hopes I would share my honest thoughts and experiences, which I have done.for the value and clarity.

The mounting systems on these players are one of the largest differences between them & lesser players; they are solid-cast metal harnesses with mobile, &#34;floating&#34; T-locks that do both a great job of supporting the player, allowing versatility and security in mounting the units to the headrest support poles.  Most other competitors for half the price have nylon band that you have to cinch down around the unit and headrest support poles that are a pain and tend to slouch over time.  Minimal cords (largely due to a single power cord & IR headphones not requiring any plug-ins) give it a clean appearance in a nice luxury sedan and increases the ease of my children getting out of the back seat exponentially.  Probably the most important aspect of this player is picture quality, which is outstanding; and I would relate to that of a Retina display on an iPad- very vivid and seems that they almost solved the sun glare problem.  They also do not show any signs of aging from being constantly installed in the car during the hot months of summer, only time will tell for the winter.  Finally, the biggest difference to us and a major reason for purchasing these units at a higher price, was the steady-state drive.  Those who are not familiar with this aspect may completely overlook this most-important characteristic that differentiates this player from other products; since this will be our third pair of rear entertainment players in five years, I can attest to the importance of this in terms of durability for those looking for this product to entertain young children.  The past two set of players (not solid-state) had front 'doors' that opened with a latch which always 'happened' to get broke off from certain someones trying to change a disc by themselves, while their loving parents were trying to keep the vehiclebetween the lines; and read the disc with a floating eye-reader, rather than a fixed eye from a uniform read point constantly.  Just for the durability factor, I will always opt for solid-state drive rather than door and floating eye reader; the solid-state players 'feed' the discs into a slot on the side or bottom.  Only time will tell to the durability of this, but my hypothesis should prove to be sound.  The only slight minus to a solid-state is that it seems to be much more finicky with reading scratched or smudged discs than floating-eyed readers; but then we just need to keep the DVDs in better shape, folks!",2015-08-15

US,38125790,R1H9GB94O86YEI,B00M4C7APA,793784087,Garmin nüvi 52LM 5-Inch Portable Vehicle GPS with Lifetime Maps (US),Mobile_Electronics,5,0,0,N,N,Powerful GPS - Great buy,"I bought this Garmin after my TomTom XL was stolen from my car. I have to say, I'm very pleased so far.<br /><br />Hopefully this review will answer a few questions that you may have yourself, so that you can see if this is the right GPS for you.<br /><br />Off the bat, the first thing I noticed is how quickly the satellites find your location. Sometimes my TomTom would take a few minutes to locate me, but with the 52LM, it never seems to go over 10-15 seconds.<br /><br />One of the features I really loved about my TomTom was the mutli-line information on the screen. It would list my current time, the time I would arrive, how fast I was going, all on the screen. I was sad at first to find Garmins on screen information was very simple, but later rejoiced as I found you can have FOUR customizable &#34;widgets&#34; on the screen, which closley resembles the mutli-line format from TomTom. For example, you can pick Current Time, Arrival Time, Distance, Elevation (if that's your thing) , Speed, etc.<br /><br />Also, the big 5 inch screen is a plus, almost too big if you don't find the correct spot in your car.<br /><br />Another thing I HATED about my TomTom was that when you added a Favorite, and titled it e.g. &#34;Work&#34; it would delete the address, so if a friend needed the exact address to one of your favorites then you were out of luck, because it simply showed the title of the favorite and not the location. With my Garmin, it STILL shows the location as well as letting you name it! Fantastic!<br /><br />Of course, this Garmin comes with access to other cool stuff including Emergency services.<br /><br />All in all, I think an in car GPS is the best investment you can make, for yourself or for your kids , especially new drivers. Gets rid of the anxiety of being lost and it's accurate 99% of the time.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a powerful GPS that isn't loaded with a lot of &#34;gimmick&#34; features (*cough* like Bluetooth dialing *cough*) then I highlyrecommend this one. Just take caution, because a GPS is like candy to car thieves, which I learned the hard way with my TomTom.",2015-08-15

Good spacing too for the bulky vertical plugs, as well.<br /><br />Another subtle aspect that need to be highlighted is the USB ports.  It has two 2.4A ports (labeled as \\""Super Charge\\"") and two 1A ports (labeled as \\""Universal\\"").  It is a bit odd nomenclature, but the practicality is the entire 5V output is 6.8A.

It works great playing audio books while I exercise, which is all I will use it for. It was easy to load up the content using my PC. I like the included earbuds and the volume is sufficient that I can hear it over traffic on busy streets. After messing around with it for a while, I was able to figure out how to select a book, start and stop the audio and change the volume. It loses my place if I shut it off so I'll probably just leave it on.<br /><br />The problem with the user interface is that the function of the buttons is not consistent from screen to screen. Sometimes the volume button(!) takes you back a screen, sometimes it is back button. There are long pushes and short pushes. Nobody wants to figure out and memorize all of this - my wife wanted to throw it across the room.

Well worth the price, which is not much to begin with compared to others that are way overpriced (looking at you BeatsAudio).<br />The only issues I found were these:<br />1. The touch sensitive buttons, though very cool compared to physical push buttons, are easy to trigger when picking the device up from the top. After a few times of accidentally doing this I learned to grab it from the side, problem solved.<br />2. The play/pause button doesn't control Pandora app very well. It paused fine but wouldn't resume play. It works fine on my Google Play Music app (I have a MotoX 1st Gen) so this may just be the Pandora app.<br />3. I noticed that when charging the device it emitted a humming noise. A YouTube reviewer noticed it to.

I have a car camera in every vehicle our family owns and each camera is different based on what was available at the time.  I have only had one wreck.  It was at a four way stop and I stopped and was turning left.  The vehicle coming the opposite way was approaching his stop sign as I was going through.  He ran through his stop and hit my rear quarter panel.  Know what he said when the cop arrived.  He said I ran the stop sign.  You should have seen the look on the guys face when I told the officer that I had a car camera.  Case closed.<br /><br />Anyway.  I have learned to buy simple inexpensive car cameras.  I dont need GPS or G sensors.  I do not like G sensors because any vibration in the car or camera mount can alert the G sensor and it will lock the file.  If that happens enough then your sd car fills up with locked files that will not be overwritten like normal files.  That can stop all recording until you erase the locked files.  The description says the camera has a G sensor but it does not. Also, the LEDs for night driving are not automatic and there are only two LEDs. They have to be turned on manually.  Now if you have had cameras with the LEDs for night driving then you know they are pretty worthless because they do not shine enough to illuminate anything more than a few feet in front of the camera which is not helpfull for video at night.  Your headlights provide the illumination.  In my experience most of these cameras are ok at night but you will not be able to read words or license plates.<br /><br />The setup is easy on the camera and the instructions understandable.  I recorded a clip at 720x480 which is one less than the highest resolution the camera offers.  You judge for yourself.<br /><br />I do not know how long the camera will last but I will update if it stops working.  Also dont turn motion sensitivity on unless you need it.  With it off the camera operates like a normal car cam.  It turns on and starts recording when you start the car and then turns off a few seconds after you turn the ignition off.",2015-08-12

There must not be many of us who want to listen to CD's without downloading them to a device or they would make a better choice of personal players. I love to listen to Books on CD while walking or gardening. I think this player has brought me more aggravation than pleasure.

This also makes it useful for many purposes including serving as an accurate time source for many applications requiring time sync including Amateur radio JT65 and WSPR use.<br /><br />The package comes attractively boxed with all software on a mini CD ROM and adequate instructions plus some velcro and a suction cap to anchor down the lead in your application.

One IMPORTANT thing to know that will save you tons of headache: If the panel you are installing this tweeter on is too thin, the mounting screws will bottom out on the solder connections of the voice coil to the terminals and cause catastrophic failure! I'm ashamed to say, but I couldn't figure it at first and assumed I had defective tweeters. When I realize what was happening it was very obvious. The supplied mounting screws are long enough to short to the terminals and/or force their way into the solder connections enough to destroy the contact. I ruined 3 tweeters before I figured out what was happening, but fortunately I was able to salvage them by re-soldering the connections.

When I first got it I used the SD card included (and later a SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card). Updated firmware from website then installed it in the front as Blackvue suggested. Used the iphone to change features within the camera, which was a little of a hassle due to the password -claimed it was such and such in the papers that came with it, and it wasn't. I had to go online and find others that had the same issue and used the password they got in with. Took about an hour to finally get in. Not a big issue once I got in.<br /><br />Checked video, it was terrible. Figured it was the card and firmware update. Checked online and I wasn't the only one experiencing this.<br />Contacted Blackuve and they said &#34;because you purchased from Amazon and you live in the US, we cannot and will not help you&#34; - cut short and dry; they said it ruder / more unprofessional.<br /><br />So I dealt with it, and waited for another firmware update thinking it would help. Updated SD card to the SanDisk Extreme Plus SD card) helped some, but not by too much.<br /><br />Moved the camera done some from the rear view mirror (closer to the dashboard) and it helped a little more. So at this time, it was in the middle of my windshield, but still in the middle. Video was okay, still couldn't see license plates and that is huge with me. (a lot of hit and runs here).<br /><br />Since purchase, it would stop working, out of the blue. I would always leave it plugged in (I *did not* use parking mode; and with my cars, the power cuts off after 10 minutes auto) and from time to time, after starting the car, the recording would not even start until the GPS would kick in, which meant it would not start for almost half my journey. At times, the GPS would kick in, and the record would never start. There were times it didn't record at all, but the recording light would flash. I would get home and there would be nothing recorded. I would check on the phone and I would see live view, but it was not filling up. That happened more than 7 times.<br /><br />It would restart itself randomly. Very annoying, especially when you thought it was recording. I would be in the car over an hour and it would just say &#34;Blackvue for your driving safety&#34; for the first time, after an hour of driving, so I missed all that time. :|<br /><br />It died February 19th, 2014. I had my son look at it and we worked on it together and got it back up and running. And yes, all that happened within 2 months.<br /><br />Again died 2 weeks later. Fixed.<br /><br />Got sick of it and purchased 2 GoPro's used the Blackvue in the back, which strangely, the video was great. I could actually see front license plates, but where I live, SC, front license plates aren't expected; so I only saw tourists or vanity plates.<br /><br />Blackvue died again a month and half later. Had my son look at it because I was sick of it. He said he didn't want to mess with it again, but I talked him into it because I needed it for speed/mph reporting. He said it was due to power. The cord wasn't connecting.<br /><br />Got it working again. Left it plugged in so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore and only unplugged it if there were an emergency, which meant if I had to update the firmware, format the card (which you could do in the camera, but mine would not do that), change cards or get info, I couldn't do that.<br /><br />Two months after that, not even a full two months, the SD card function, that holds the card in and let it come out, the spring, broke, so I could not get the card to go in, and I almost couldn't get the damn thing to come out, I had to force it out. Asked my son once again to fix it.. he took a look and said it was not fixable because the way they had it put together inside. I told him he could keep it. He said he didn't want it - and this is a guy who will take anything for his electronics and he didn't want that. So I tossed it. I spent over $300 on something that is now gone. *It did not last $300 worth.*<br /><br />All in all, it lasted 1 year and a couple of months, but all during that, was nothing but problems.<br /><br />- The this entire time, in the front, the video was terrible, even with upscale [expensive none the less] SD High card.<br />- restarted over and over - sometimes would not even restart, I would have to unplug it and plug it back to get it to start - while driving! sometimes I would have to drive without it.<br />- support for it? there isn't any.

US,52486291,R3ORXLHEDCGNYU,B00Y2100OO,161663398,LiteXim All in One Large Touch Screen Hands Free Digital Mp3/Mp4 Music Player Music/Audio/FM radio & Micro SD Card (Black),Mobile_Electronics,5,7,8,N,N,Excellent Price for Very Good Product,"There are only a couple of things I didnt like about this MP3 player. The instructions included with this MP3 player don't apply to this model. Plus, you have to buy an SD chip for the memory. The FLASH DRIVE is just large enough to hold the system memory. You cant store music files on this, unless you buy a SD chip. (They cost $6 for a 16 gig chip.) With that out of the way,  I'm very impressed this player. For starters, they fixed the one big problem, that the older cheap MP3 players had. On older models, you could not access the folders that held your songs. If you had a 8 gig chip, the only way to browse through the music, was song by song. Now they have files set up, so you can scan by band. Once you click on the band file, you can chose the album. Once you chose the album file, you can chose the song. With literally hundreds of albums able to be stored on a 16 gig chip, that makes this a very functional MP3 player. As for the sound, I'm really happy with the quality. The digital decoder, and amplifier is of sufficient quality, to let you listen to music without distortion. Of course, the weak link of the chain would be the headphones. (Don't even bother using the earphones that come with this. Buy good quality headphones or earphones, and use those.) Another issue with these cheap MP3 players, concerns the battery life. Of course its rechargeable, but there's a trick to recharging some Li-ion batteries. (READ BOTTOM OF REVIEW.)<br /><br />So you get a nice MP3 player, that can clip onto your pants or shirt, when you're out and about. It has FM radio (the headphone wire is the antennae, so don't expect to use a Bluetooth transmitter with this, and listen to the radio.) You can record with this too. (again, if you buy a chip.) I suppose you could download a video on this (like a Utoob clip, or gif file), but I don't think it would be worth the effort. Why watch it on a one inch screen? Also, you could download a book, but the screen maybe would show 5-7 words at a time. It would take forever just to read a page. Right now, this player is available for less than a ten dollar bill, which really surprises me. An affordable MP3 player? Excellent. Actually, trading out the SD chips, is a cool option. If you have a lot of music, you can create various SD chips with MP3 files, for your jazz music, alternative, EDM, or folk and classical. By the way, the MP3 player does read WMP files, in case you rip in that format. (As I do.)<br />UPDATE: (September 29th 2015)<br />I've been using this MP3 player at the gym, four days a week, for a couple of months now. It always recharges well, plus it keeps a charge for at least a few hours. I have not had a single problem with this MP3 player. The battery is EXCELLENT on this model. Listen, I've been burnt with inexpensive MP3 players, so I was very cautious reviewing the LiteXim product. I expected it not to perform, and I was wrong to doubt the quality of this product. Considering how inexpensive it is, I have to admit, its one of the best bargains, that I have had the pleasure to review. So I raised the review from four stars to five.  If you want an MP3 player, and don't mind supplying your own SD chip (which are so inexpensive now), this is a good choice.<br /><br />If you do run into a problem with the player, it will be with the battery not wanting to take a recharge. Here's the fix.<br /><br />RECHARGING a LITHIUM ION BATTERY, that wont recharge.<br />Sometimes, the battery will wear out.  You can try to recharge them, but nothing happens. The trick is to remove ALL remaining charge from the battery, before you recharge. To do this, you need to turn the MP3 player ON. You'll get a WELCOME screen, a &#34;LOW BATTERY LEVEL&#34; screen, then a &#34;BYE BYE&#34; screen. Then turn it off. Then turn it on, repeating the process, until the player only FLASHES the welcome screen for a second. Keep going, turning it on, after it turns off, until it WILL NOT TURN ON AT ALL. When its completelydead, plug it into the charger. Now, be patient. It takes DAYS to recharge. I have found, that if you keep the MP3 player turned ON during charging, that it will charge better. (Maybe let it charge in OFF mode, for a couple of days. Then, let it charge in ON mode. ) Be patient. Eventually, in 2-3 days, the battery will recharge. The charge will be good for 4-5 hours, maybe less.<br />NO INSTRUCTIONS<br />You have four buttons. POWER is also the PLAY button. You have the - / + buttons on top, on either side of the &#34;M&#34; button. You need to go into the &#34;M&#34; screen, to access everything like VOLUME, REPEAT, etc. Use the - / + buttons to navigate. The &#34;M&#34; button selects. Volume is hard to control on this MP3 player. You need to find that MODE screen, then select VOLUME, then select the volume with navigator buttons. However, once you discover this for yourself, its fairly easy. I deducted a star, because of no instructions (at least no instructions that apply to this model), and because it doesn't come with any usable memory. Actually, I'd like to say FOUR AND A HALF STARS. ITs a nice MP3 player, even if you do have to supply your own SD Chip. So for the price, how much can you complain?<br />I was provided a free MP3 player in exchange for a fair and honest review.tient. It takes DAYS to recharge. I have found, that if you keep the MP3 player turned ON during charging, that it will charge better. (Maybe let it charge in OFF mode, for a couple of days. Then, let it charge in ON mode. ) Be patient. Eventually, in 2-3 days, the battery will recharge. The charge will be good for 4-5 hours, maybe less. NO INSTRUCTIONS You have four buttons. POWER is also the PLAY button. You have the - / + buttons on top, on either side of the &#34;M&#34; button. You need to go into the &#34;M&#34; screen, to access everything like VOLUME, REPEAT, etc. Use the - / + buttons to navigate. The &#34;M&#34; button selects. Volume is hard to control on this MP3 player. You need to find that MODE screen, then select VOLUME, then select the volume with navigator buttons. However, once you discover this for yourself, its fairly easy. I deducted a star, because of no instructions (at least no instructions that apply to this model), and because it doesn't come with any usable memory. Actually, I'd like to say FOUR AND A HALF STARS. ITs a nice MP3 player, even if you do have to supply your own SD Chip. So for the price, how much can you complain?

You really have to look at the speaker in person, to appreciate its futuristic look. That is mostly thanks to the honeycomb design on top of the speaker grill at the front of the speaker. On top of that, the polygonal-shaped buttons located at the top of the speaker add to the futuristic look. Overall, the design of the speaker is on-point, and nothing like anything seen on other Bluetooth speakers on the market. It doesn't end there - the build quality of the speaker is as solid as it looks. Its matte plastic (soft-touch plastic) construction all around allows the speaker to not draw fingerprints and scratches, and allows the speaker to feel very well-built and sturdy. I don't see this speaker falling apart anytime soon.<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - 10/10<br />With this speaker, I was able to get around 8 hours of music playback time, which falls short of the promised 10 hours of music playback time. However, don't get me wrong here - 8 hours of music playback time is PHENOMENAL compared to other Bluetooth speakers in this price range. 8 hours. Of straight music-playing. Trust me, you won't have any complaints with the battery life of this speaker.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY - 9.5/10<br />At first when I got this speaker, the sound quality was almost mediocre - the overall sound was muffled, and it was horrible. But then when I used this speaker for about 2 hours or so, and let the speakers \\""burn-in\\"", the sound got much clearer. It got clearer to the point where its sound quality is one of the best in its class - well-balanced mids, highs, and lows, as well as just enough bass for my taste. The bass IS a bit overpowering, but I personally like that sort of sound. Vocals and instrumentals are quite clear, nothing crazy, but for a Bluetooth speaker of this price range, it's fantastic.<br /><br />FUNCTIONALITY - 10/10<br />Just like any other Bluetooth speaker and any other device in today's market, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB. The standard stuff, and it works fine, so no complaints there. There's also an AUX port, in case your device's Bluetooth doesn't work, or your device simply doesn't have Bluetooth. Finally, the speaker also comes with a TF (Micro SD Card) slot, allowing you to play music on the speaker WITHOUT ANY OTHER DEVICE! This is quite fantastic in my opinion, as you can just carry around this speaker (with a Micro SD Card, of course), jamming to your favorite tune. Overall, the functionality of this speaker is great.<br /><br />VERDICT/OVERALL EXPERIENCE - 10/10<br />Overall, I really can't find much to complain about this speaker. From its build quality, battery life, sound quality, and functionality, the speaker excels in every single aspect. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a mid-range Bluetooth speaker that sounds better than a low-range speaker, or even your phone's speaker.arket, this speaker is rechargeable via micro USB.

And even keeping it in your car could ruin the battery over time if you do a lot of outside parking in warm weather.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br /> - Works as described<br /> - It looks and feels like good quality<br /> - Nice quality 120-volt AC and 12-volt DC charging adapters<br /> - Nicely designed case<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br /> - Mine came with no user guide. Not sure why.<br /><br /> - - - Capacity - - -<br /><br />The stated mAh (milli-Amp hours) for all these battery packs is NOT the amount of amp-hours delivered at 12 volts (or 5, 16, 19 volts). It's the amp-hours delivered at 3.7 volts by the internal Li-ion cells before the conversion to higher voltage output. This unit's 16.8-amp hour spec means you would get a maximum of 5.18 amp-hours at 12-volts, for example. It's 62 watt-hours of power, no matter which voltage output you're using.<br /><br />- - - Connector Sizes - - -<br /><br />It comes with lots of connector tips for 12-16-19 volt output, but it's nice the know the main unit uses very common connector sizes, in case you want to attach your own cables. The 12-16-19 volt output is a 5.5mm/2.1mm barrel connection. The input (for recharging) is 3.5mm/1.35mm.<br /><br />  - - - Nighttime Power in an RV - - -<br /><br />It's working well for me to power two bright LED lamp fixtures a tiny exhaust fan in my small RV.<br /><br />One minor hassle is, the unit shuts itself off after about 1 minute if it's not being used. There is no auto-start. You have to hit the battery power button whenever you want to turn your devices on. You can't just turn your lights off and on without restarting the battery pack. The competing models I looked at also work this way.<br /><br />Also, you could accidentally bump the voltage to 16 or 19 volts if you hit the power button an extra time (or at the wrong time), possibly frying your 12-volt devices.<br /><br />- - - Disclosure - - -<br /><br />The manufacturer gave me this item for review.

I took it with me on my cruise vacation, hoping to capture some nice shots in and near the water, but all I got was the reflection of the translucent covering on top of the lens.  For some stupid reason, the manufacture designed the camera with a waterproof case made of very poor clarity plastic that totally screws up the quality of every single picture it takes.  The lens focused only on the plastic case on every picture, so every picture was just a picture of the plastic case, with what I really wanted to take a picture of just the showing has some blurry blob in the background.

However, the vendor is super-fast and DHL managed to get it from the warehouse in China on a Friday morning to my doorstep in Florida by Monday afternoon - very good first impression, and major props to DHL as the shipper!<br /><br />Installation in my wife's 2014 Jetta SE was easy, and the longest part of the job was tucking the USB cable for the (optional) front DVR camera into the headliner. I would recommend using one of the trim tool kit's from Amazon, such as this one http://www.amazon.com/KINGLAKE®-Panel-Removal-Radio-Installer/dp/B00HNMLQAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1438978963&sr=8-3&keywords=car+stereo+trim+tool which helps getting the USB cable under the headliner without any drama.<br /><br />The Joying web site said only SD/TF cards up to 32Gb, but I filled a 128Gb card with MP3, AAC, and FLAC songs and plugged it into the SD slot and then powered the head-unit on. The first start-up took about 45 seconds, and I was a little worried that it would take that long each time I started the car, but subsequent starts were around 20 seconds. Would be nice if it was a bit faster, but not too bad a delay.<br /><br />A little later I found a configuration setting that let's you set a sleep delay from 5 minutes, up to a few hours. What this does is put the head-unit in a sleep mode, but keeps it powered on for a quick restart of around 5 seconds. I set it to 15 minutes, and it's super nice when you are stopping and starting your car multiple times during the day - get back in and turn the ignition on within the 15 minute timer and the music is pumping within seconds. Since these head-units use a decent amount of power, I don't think I'd leave it in this mode for more that 15 or 30 minutes as it will cause some additional drain on your battery in this mode.<br /><br />So how did I like the operation of the head-unit?  The GPS software is nice, and after 15 years with stand-alone Garmin units, the IGO software is a nice change. The radio app supports RDS, and has 18 presets you can set manually, or press the magnifying glass icon to have it automatically set the first 18 stations it finds. Reception seems good, and it gets the same stations the VW RCD310 radio was picking up in my driveway.<br /><br />The Video app found a couple of MP4 video files on the SD card, and plays them as you would expect. I found the movies to be a little dark but that was mid-day in the Florida sun. Checking again in the evening, and they looked great.<br /><br />The Music app works, but could do with some improvements. It takes about 30 seconds to scan all the songs on my 128Gb SD card before it starts playing them. Unfortunately it rescans the SD card every time you turn the car on, so that was a pain. Took a few minutes to login to my Google account, and through Google Play was able to download the PowerAmp music player. Problem solved!  It saves the last song played and starts with that song the next time the car is started. Double bonus is that it can be configured to NOT rescan the SD and USB storage devices, so it's ready to go within a few seconds.<br /><br />I plugged an older iPod Classic into one of the USB cables Joying provide, but nothing happened. With the Pioneer unit in my car the music player detects the iPod and presents the contents of the iPod in the same format as SD files. With the Joying I couldn't get the iPod to work at all, so I emailed their support staff to get their help. First thing the next morning I had an email telling me the iPod needed a special cable that could be ordered from their web site, so I ordered one. When it arrived I saw that it had a 16-pin block connector on one end that needed to be plugged in to the motherboard inside the head-unit. Ten minutes to remove the head0unit from the dashboard, 5 minutes to find a small screwdriver, 2 minutes to open the case, 1 minute to plug the new cable it, 2 minutes to close up the case, and 5 minutes to put it all back into the dash - a bit annoying as I would have ordered the 'special cable' at the same time as head-unit if I had known that it was required.<br /><br />After enabling the iPod support in the configuration settings, and starting the iPod application it still did not work. The Joying head-unit displayed the name of my iPod but never displayed any of the songs or playlists on it. I should mention this is a modified iPod Classic and has 128Gb of flash memory. Plugging in a newer iPod Touch worked fine, so it probably does not like the older operating system on the Classic.<br /><br />The Car Recorder application is cool, and records video from the front-facing camera I installed. The camera itself is a basic unit, and the Car Recorder app also worked with a Logitech C920 camera I tested it with. It saves the video in compressed format onto the SD card in the GPS slot, and this is not configurable so I replaced the Joying supplied 8Gb card with a 64Gb Class-10 Samsung card. With 4 gigs for the GPS software there is lots of space for recording your trips, or just day to day driving. Using the File Explorer application I could see that there were multiple MP4 files and LOG files with the same name. The  LOG files contain the GPS coordinates and date & time information, and looking at the video's for playback in the Car Recorder app overlays that metadata onto the MP4 video being shown, but it will not be present if you just copy the MP4 file of the GPS card and give it to someone in the event of a proble - always give them the LOG file that matches the MP4 file.<br /><br />My one real annoyance is the Bluetooth app while streaming music from my phone - music comes through fine, and the forward and back controls do what you expect but there is no song title or artist information. Looks like they have a little work to do getting that displayed.<br /><br />I don't have any 3G / 4G  USB devices to test internet access with, but it connects to my home WiFi while in the driveway, and it also connects to my iPhone running as a personal hotspot if you want Spotify, Wave or other services that require internet access. Looking at the User Guide I see the head-unit can function as a wireless hotspot itself, so I'm assuming that only works with a 3G or 4G-USB device.<br /><br />Overall, a very nice unit with a couple of minor irritants. Since I bought it there has been an upgrade that I applied, and it looks like the Joying folks will continue to release updated code for these head-units. Very happy with this purchase!",2015-08-07

The bottom portion of the speaker has a slight angle to it, giving you more control over sound direction than most speakers in this market segment. Between the top and bottom areas of the speaker is a thin light band that glows (or blinks) blue or red depending on the speaker's connection or pairing status. While the design looks great and is very stylish, it's bright enough that it would probably be distracting if you wanted to listen to this speaker in a dark room.<br /><br />The individual raised buttons look good. While their wood grain pattern is slightly different than the rest of the speaker, it blends nicely and subtly sets the buttons apart. They all have raised symbols on them denoting their functions. My only gripe with them is that the Volume Up button is on the left and the Volume Down button is on the right, which is opposite of most speakers I've used or seen.<br /><br />The speaker volume has a nice range. I listened to a variety of music with it, though my favorite testing track is Sam Robson's \\""I Need Thee Every Hour\\"" from his YouTube channel (look him up!). It sounded beautiful through the speaker, and the volume was able to get plenty loud. The on-device volume setting is independent of your phone/tablet/etc's bluetooth volume setting, so make sure you haven't turned one of the two down by accident if you find the speaker won't get loud. While I couldn't find information on what version of Bluetooth this speaker uses, I suspect it's Bluetooth 4.0 as I didn't notice any discernible lag between the video on my Galaxy Note 4 and the audio coming out of the speaker.<br /><br />I really like how the speaker uses different status tones for things like Power On, Bluetooth Paired, and Max Volume. A lot of other speakers use spoken words instead of tones, and usually they just come out sounding like very poorly pronounced or broken English, and it gives the speaker a cheap feel. My only gripe with the status tones is the Power On tone ... it is ALWAYS loud no matter where you have the volume set when you turned the speaker off, and it often startles me. Overall, though, it's not a deal-breaker by any means.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this speakers sound, looks, and especially its slightly tilted design and status-light ring; I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a portable single-driver Bluetooth speaker based off its performance.

I was able to easily connect the speaker to my phone as well as my tablet. The buttons on this speaker do have a tiny lag to them but that doesn't bother me because it's not a long lag at all. I also like that the buttons are marked clearly and bigger then most speakers I've seen so if you don't have the best vision you would definitely be able to see what each button is for. The speaker doesn't get overly loud but it does fill a room nicely. I also really like that this speaker comes with a carrying case so you can easily take it with you when traveling or to just keep it from getting dirty.

I have an armored rubber case on my iPad Air 1 (wifi model), after a short drop out of a Logitech keyboard shattered my previous device.

I would recommend spending those few extra $s and buying an iPod Nano from Apple. That being said, my three-star review is directed firmly at Apple and the 7th gen Nano itself...<br /><br />Firstly, this is truly (as Jony Ive would no doubt tell you) a wonderful, magical device and a miracle of modern engineering. The 7th gen's internal amp is a slight step up from that of the 6th gen Nano with a cleaner sound and marginally quieter noise floor, although I still prefer the size (and clip) of the 6th gen model. Here's why the 7th gen Nano only gets three stars from me. For a dedicated DAP that does basically nothing but play music and has no internet-connection capabilities of any kind, 16 Gb storage is pathetic and paltry. (Technically, it can play video too, but with the tiny screen and tiny amount of storage, I'm not sure why Apple even bothered with this capability.) After waiting three years for a refresh of this product, what do we get? Improved internals? More storage? At least the OPTION to pay lots of extra $$$$s for more storage? Nope. We get new colors. That's right -the opportunity to buy the exact same thing, but in a slightly different color.  Come on Apple. Get your act together.",2015-08-04

I bought this a few years ago for $39.99 with prime. Now it is even lower. I may pick up another. It pairs seamlessly and when compared to my sister's small jawbone it blew it away. I now have a BEM as well. While the BEM is more portable it does not have the sound quality or power of the Oomtz. I recommend keeping the supplying music device's volume at about 75% or lower and use the speaker to control the volume. It packs a punch and there is very little distortion even at high volume. It's not the smallest unit out there but I think the better bass and more crisp sound is aided by the shape and size of this unit. The battery has good life even when using it to fill my whole family room with sound. Also, the speaker phone comes in handy while using the unit.

I may be spoilt from simple mono banders and the simple & basic programming the Baofengs with CHIRP, but programming the VR-6600Pro manually is a chore.<br /><br />But once you have it programmed it is easy to use and a powerful rig.  I would just not recommend it to a novice user who is just starting out in radio.  Once I had the radio programmed it was a piece of cake for my daughter to operate the radio, but difficult for me to remember the steps to make changes.  I would find myself having to scroll through bands via the [B] key a lot if wanted to toggle from VHF to UHF and back to VHF, because there is no backwards with the [B]. One Press to go from VHF to 220Mhz, another press to skip the 300Mhz band , then 6 more presses to go back to VHF, as you have toggle through the extra bands.  Even when you disable the wide RX coverage, you still have Line In, AM and FM bands to toggle through.  I have sent a feature request into VGC to see about getting Line In, AM and FM moved into the expanded section.  I would like to just have 144, 220 & 440 on my mobile rig!<br /><br />While not a lab grade test, Amelia and I were able to have a QSO in simplex VHF from our house to a ham in Tracy 39 miles away as the crow flies with 50 watts.  All our on air reports have been favorable, nothing out of the ordinary either pro or con.  So no objections to on air performance at all.<br /><br /> My theories on the overall feature set and radio operation are the following:<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is a land mobile radio company where features, adjustability and flexibility are king.  The radios will be programmed by a technician, who has time to study and configure the radio for a semi static operation.  The average business will not reprogram frequencies often and will mostly just use the memory function.  This leads to a lot of advance features, but less focus on simpler operations, programing ease and the User Interface/Experience.<br /><br />* VeroTelecom is innovating with the APRS features, but again, it is deep in the feature set and not a novice grade set up.<br /><br />* When I sent in a feature request that would make manual programming easier for hams, the factory politely vetoed my suggestion to retain maximum flexibility.  I think this is due to the land mobile vision.<br /><br />APRS Setup<br /><br />I have the APRS module ready to set up, I downloaded APRSdroid for my Android phone, I sent off and got a passcode, but have not had time to set up APRS on the radio. I will get the APRS function set up as soon as I mount the radio.<br /><br /> Quick Reference<br /><br />There are a couple short cuts and quick references I will be setting up for the radio.  Little things that can make a hams life easier.  Keep an eye out on the VR6600 Facebook page.",2015-08-04

You will need the reviews on Amazon because documentation is somewhere between minimal and nonexistent.<br />A couple of comments:<br />There are buttons that I have no idea what they do. One I accidentally pushed caused a lock icon to appear briefly, so I have to assume that it locks that file for later viewing. I have no idea which button that is nor was I able to replicate the behavior.<br />When you’re changing the language note that you cannot get into the menu if the device is plugged in. The menu only appears when powered by battery. You hit “menu” twice because the first push takes you to settings and the second push moves you to the menu tab with language options. Other reviews diagram what to look for in the default Russian for changing the language.<br />If you use a zip-tie to connect it to your rear view mirror you then don't have to worry about it coming disconnected on hot days. Carefully place so that it does not prevent you putting your mirror in night mode.<br />If the device keeps shutting itself off it likely has one of two problems:<br />If the light is red, it's losing power and the battery is not sufficient to run it without available power. Check your power cord and reseat it until the red light goes out and turns pink or blue (pink = charging, blue=charged).<br />If the light is not red but it repeatedly shuts off, take out the MicroSD card and format it on your computer. Although it overwrites old data, deleted files may still be enough to make the device think there is no storage available. Once you format it’ll work again.<br />As noted in other reviews, a class-4 MicroSD of no more than 16 GB is required. You can use a larger card, but it will not overwrite.<br />The camera is not locked into position, it moves around a bit, but if your cord is not pulling on it, it will generally hang flat.<br />The cord is extra long so that you can run it under the fascia down your A pillar and over to your power/cigarette lighter outlet. Note that it is not long enough if your power is not on the dash. Mine is in the hatch under my elbow and it's about 12 inches too short to go along the front window, down the A pillar, under the dash, and then back to the hatch where my power ports reside.<br />Generally a decent starter camera. If it dies I will probably buy a more expensive one with support and documentation, but so far so good.<br />I'm giving it 5 stars because, for the money, it's a good device.

Took less than 4 minutes.<br />2⃣ Requires a micro SD card. I used this one: [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk Ultra 32GB UHS-I/Class 10 Micro SDHC Memory Card With Adapter- SDSDQUAN-032G-G4A [Old Version]]]. It works perfectly.<br />3⃣ Reason for the 3 stars: when attempting to press the menu button, it takes quite a while to activate. (we're talking a frustrating long time...) There are simply other dash cams out there in the same price range that work.<br />4⃣ Delay shut-off time.  I like this feature, and it shows up here and there in other dash cams as well. This features allows the camera to continue recording for 30-ish seconds after you shut off the power (your car).  Smart idea since accidents can still happen if your is at a stand-still with the ignition off.<br />5⃣ Video files: It records to AVI files that play natively on a Mac. This is nice because other dash cams I've tested record to a weird codec (still AVI video though) and have to be converted prior to playing.  If you can't play the video files, use VLC Player (free download).<br /><br />If you're curious every 60 seconds of footage uses about 200mbs of memory.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful! Note the company sent me this product to demonstrate on video and offer my personal opinion. I don't work for them, nor am I paid anything that might sway my personal opinion of this product's performance.<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />- No, not really. There are other more reliable options out there in the same price range.",2015-08-04

Good video quality and the unit fits very well into the place of the old license plate light location. However there is one silly problem that makes no sense to me. The wire included with it is not long enough to reach the front of the van. Now I understand universal units not having enough wire but when I buy something made for a specific model, I do expect the wire to have been properly measured out for the vehicle (part of the custom fit). I figure it needed to be about 6 feet longer, so expect to extend the wire using an RCA barrel connector unless you tape it to the ceiling.",2015-08-04

After looking at the headrest brackets that came with the DITOP LCD monitors and the tablet mounts I decided to modify the tablet mount to receive the DITOP LCD bracket.<br /><br />I removed the bracket plate and ran the wiring down the opening around my headrest posts to one central location under a seat.  The instructions for the LCD lack installation instructions.  They only go over the buttons on the screen and the remote.<br /><br />The wiring comes with a red/fused line, blue, and black.  I believe that the red line is constant and the blue is switched.  The black was obviously ground.  I ended up putting the red/blue together and connecting them to a 12v plug that I could manually plug in and out because they are constantly on in standby.<br /><br />After about an hour install of running lines and carefully placing them inside and under the seats I was finally able to test them.<br /><br />I was amazed of the quality they showed.  I think these would make a great addition to any vehicle.  I recommend them.  I included installation pictures.es.",2015-08-02

So, it thought, i'll give it the benefit of the doubt and move it to a larger space. That is when this product really showed it colors. I took it about 15 feet.... that's all, and all it did was sputter and go in and out. I was running this off a newer iMac which has pretty amazing bluetooth capabilities.<br />So long story short; if you want something to run off your phone or tablet and are planning to be in the same room as the device, then this may be the speaker for you.

""current pace"" explanation here!","i have had this watch for about 3 months now. i have never owned any other type of gps enable watch before this one. however, my father owns the forerunner 305 and my mother has the forerunner 405 so i do still have some experience with those watches as well. in my opinion this is the best watch of the group hands down. the watch literally feels like a standard stopwatch. no extra weight, no extra bulk. the 405 does not quite fit like a normal watch due to the antenna extending down into the wrist strap. this watch is extremely comfortable to wear at all times and very adjustable in size (the holes go around the entire strap). this watch is very basic for runners and thus lacks the extra bells and whistles that the 305 and 405 have such as &#34;ghost&#34; trainers and &#34;breadcrumb&#34; directions. however this watch gives you current pace (more in just a moment), distance, calories, time, heart rate, and chimes at each &#34;lap.&#34; for a standard running regimen this watch is more than enough to supplement a good, hard workout.<br /><br />CURRENT PACE EXPLANATION<br />-i have noticed a lot of confusion about the idea of this watch lacking current &#34;real-time&#34; pace. However, to be quite honest, &#34;real time&#34; pace on a gps watch is pretty useless. the gps in the watch is NOT hooked up to a satellite CONTINUOUSLY. no gps in the world has this capability. instead, each gps has a certain &#34;ping&#34; time to send and receive a signal from a satellite. more advanced gps systems have quicker &#34;pings&#34; to more closely mimic a continuous connection but the connection is still never actually continuous. on watches that advertise &#34;current pace,&#34; the watch is simply showing you the exact speed at which you were going between the last two pings. basically the watch calculates the distance traveled between each ping and then uses the time it took you to go that distance to get a speed. this leaves a lot of room for random spikes and troughs in the data. no human can run at a single speed across a certain distance. the human body simply cannot set itself to &#34;cruise&#34; and go from there. thus a &#34;real time&#34; pace is fairly useless for a runner. let me give an example. if someone were to turn on their forerunner 405 and set it to show current pace and run for 20 seconds at an 8:00min/mi pace, assuming the watch has a ping every 2 seconds or so, the data would look something like this: 6:52, 7:20, 8:15,7:47, 8:30, 6:59, 8:02, 8:10, etc...obviously this data is not really constant with an 8:00min/mi pace however the person may still very well be able to hit EXACTLY an 8:00min mile. What the forerunner 110 does, rather than show the data from EACH ping, is it takes each ping and adds it to a list with every other ping that has been recorded across the time frame and averages them all together. the final number that is shown on your watch will thus be called the &#34;current AVERAGE pace.&#34; which in all honesty is MUCH more useful if one is trying to hit a certain pace goal. basically this current average pace can quite accurately depict your mile split well before you've reached the mile marker..if you speed up significantly then the ping data will thus be in a lower range and bring your &#34;average&#34; time down. now some of you might think that this means that the watch only displays a pace that doesnt refresh very often. however, the exact opposite is true. the watch will refresh the current average pace every time another ping comes in..so basically your current average pace could hypothetically move up or down with every single ping. but due to the beauty of the AVERAGE, the watch will not jump around sporadically like in a &#34;current pace&#34; but rather stay around a certain time and gradually move up or down according to your speed. in essence, the &#34;current pace&#34; on a lot of gps watches is really truly useless and most people will never end up using it because it doesnt actuallygive you any solid data to work off of. because the data is changing so dramatically each second, the data is just plain useless. FYI: some runners may have noticed very random spikes in their &#34;fastest&#34; pace that the garmin software will show after uploading the data. basically, &#34;fastest pace&#34; during your run means that for one single ping during the run you might have run a 5:34min/mile pace for all of 1 second. however, because that pace is still part of the data that is added into the overall time, it still counts as your &#34;fastest pace&#34; for the run even though your average mile pace for the workout was only 8:34...<br /><br />another nice thing about this watch is that after each run is saved to the history on the watch, it can be accessed to show the average pace over the entire distance rather than just the mile splits. the mile splits for older runs can only be accessed and viewed once the watch is connected to a computer and the data is uploaded.<br /><br />hope all of this has cleared up any confusion about current average pace for the forerunner 110!",2015-08-02

This product set's  up is very simple and easy. Clip camera to windshield mount, plug in the power cable which has a micro USB that goes to the camera and standard USB on the supply side. If your car is not equipped with a USB charging port it comes with the cigarette lighter adapter. A micro SD card is necessary,but not included, for recording. The suction cup mounting is extremely strong and I have no concern that it will fall off, even in extreme weather. The angles in the description are accurate, and it picks up a clear image in that range. There is no infrared, so what you get at night on dark roads is only what your headlights illuminate.

Solid speaker for under 50$...,"Was instantly impressed when I synced this to my phone and first started playing some tunes. It's loud, clear, and there's a decent amount of bass. However, don't be expecting anything room shattering; it's got just enough 'thump' to have a balanced sound.<br /><br />Really, though, the quality of sound this thing puts out is just impressive. I sat it side by side with my 130$ Creative Sound Blaster AXX 200, and it was going toe to toe. I honestly think, at the end of the day, the Sentey sounds better. It just has a 'fuller' sound to me. The Creative arguably has clearer highs and mids, but the Sentey's got it beat in bass. And overall, it just sounds less 'tinny' than the Creative.<br /><br />GREAT bang for your buck at its current price. This speaker sounds like it should at least cost 50 or 60$. It's a great buy for a budget bluetooth speaker.<br /><br />I've been investigating Sentey more and more lately after seeing how many products they have on Amazon and all the great reviews they've been getting. Apparently they are a US founded company, which is awesome. However, when perusing their website, I see a lot of grammatical and spelling errors common in foreign hired help. Whether they outsource their media building or not, that is somewhat concerning coming from a company claiming to reside in Florida. Who knows... maybe they are a bunch of American orientals?? Lol<br /><br />Still, the quality of this speaker is on par for what you pay. It's solid. Feels durable. It's quite hefty in the hand, and has a nice rubber finish for a good grip on the outside. The buttons are large and easy to see and are touch sensitive.<br /><br />Overall... a great buy! This thing puts out more sound than it should!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it for it's current price (33$).",2015-08-01

I find it to have a strong mounting, with endless adjustments, and to be suitable for a wide range of tablets.<br /><br />FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a coupon that covered the cost of this product, so that I could review it. I did order it from Amazon.<br /><br />The device clips onto one side of the headrest pole (as seen on the product page). The designers have done an excellent job in making this a \\""universal\\"" mount. I found that based on my measurements, it will fit any tablet with a height of 5.5 inches up to 8 inches. This would be measured at the narrowest part of the tablet. The arms that hold the tablet have a spring control to hold snugly and yet release easily as well, while the main section extends and then locks into place. There are rubberized pads on top and bottom. The device has knobs for all places that tighten, so it is really easy to mount and adjust. I was worried when I saw the design that it might not hold the tablet well, but in fact it does fine. At first, the poles at the top went over the power button on my Android tablet, but even the top feet can be moved, so it worked out. I am impressed by the ingenuity that went into this unit - well done!<br /><br />There are a couple of things to consider when ordering. You must have bare support poles for this to work, and the poles need to be straight, not curved. So if you are a short person, this would not work on your seat because the headrest would be snug against the seat. Mine had a small bend on both sides, but there was still enough straight pole for the mount to work. Also, the headrest needs to be at least 2 inches above the seat back. In my case, the head rest was just barely high enough above the seat so that the tightening knob would still work. Do the measurements before you order to make sure your car will work: straight support poles, with the head rest at least 2 inches above the seat.<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended..<br /><br />Summary: A great mount for your tablet to keep the kids occupied - but check your specific car first. Highly recommended.",2015-07-31

I had purchased a different type before buying this one but I didn't realize the other style was for the sports bands that lay flat. I have the melanise loop which will not lay flat. This raised option is perfect. There is only one con I've found with this product and that is that they added an indent for the cord to go but it will not stay because of the length of the connecting piece to the battery charger. For me that's not a deal breaker. But for those who must have the cord tucked away you may need to pull out a drill and angle the hole differently at the top to make it work or find some decorative tape to embellish and hide it. It's a handsome and sleek. I anticipated it to look cheap but I was pleasantly surprised. It also has a decent weight where it won't move or turn over easily.,2015-07-31

Well actually, &#34;we&#34; don't misplace things, it's some &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; that moves them someplace else from were &#34;we&#34; put them. :)  Nice loud sound from the receivers and the flashing led is easy to see in dim light.  The flashlight on the transmitter is neat and provides a pretty good beam.  Receivers are nicely constructed and have thick support around the ring hole, was able to use a larger ring than the tiny ones supplied.  Broadcast distance was very/very good.  Tested by letting wife hide a receiver.  I started downstairs, other side of house, with receiver &#34;hidden&#34; in a desk drawer upstairs on the far side of the house. Approx. distance 20 meters through maybe 3 interior walls. I could not hear the 'beep' but my wife said 'it' beeped.  In wandering around until I finally heard it.  Didn't take too much to finally narrow a possible room location.  My ears might not give an exact location of where the sound came from but I knew it had to in there somewhere. Just simply started opening drawers and pressing the button.  Found it!!  Total time: about 5-6 minutes whereas I've spent what seemed like hours retracing steps and tearing apart the house looking. Cons: If receiver is laying totally flat, colour up, the sound is muffled because the speaker is on the back.  Wish there was a 'replacement face' or overlay for the transmitter to write down what each colour ID was assigned to.  Heck, if I can't remember where something is at,  HOW DO THEY EXPECT ME to remember what each colour represents???  Is that expecting too much from me? ;) ;)  [I know, I know - tape a cheat sheet on the back of the transmitter.] Problem not encountered yet:  How do I find the transmitter if that darn &#34;unknown force/gremlin&#34; hides it on me?

No this isn't going to perform as well as a $450 dollar unit and shouldn't be expected to.<br />But this seems to do the job well enough.<br /><br />I recently used this on work trip, and for the first time in my life, i wanted to see a cop and despite the 150 miles one way trip THERE WAS 1 COP total there and back. lol. This did give me a warning, however, as with all radar detectors, the issue is, for me at least, i like to have my music, relatively loud,and therefor cannot hear any sort of radar detector. The normal solution to this is the light up display, however when i am on unfamiliar roads with people who apparently got their license back when they were just giving them away.... (Yea im talking about most of the people that drive the 495 beltway) The last thing i would do would be to look down frequently to check the radar detector.<br /><br />So in my 300 mile testing, i found that highway mode worked reasonably well, with the occasion &#34;false&#34; alarm. I say false in quotations because i fully believe it picked up some signal from the k band, it just wasn't a warning i cared about. Many programmable road signs, will send an alert for instance.<br /><br />Best i can tell this detects h,x,k,KA,Str La bands. What any of them are i have no clue though the road signs that triggered alerts were all on the K band.<br /><br />However in city mode i surprised that this did not go bananas as they used to when close to a stores theft detection tag sensors at the door.<br /><br />The unit comes with a clear gel grip pad to help hold the unit in place, a car adapter that features an on and off button, instructions in both russian and english, and of course the radar detector.<br /><br />It is nice and low profile so it wasnt so blatantly obvious it was there despite sitting in the middle of my dash. The unit features a nice small display that shows what band it is detecting as well as the signal strength to help you gauge distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.<br /><br />The speaking, if i caught it correctly said&#34; position ahead&#34; in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)<br /><br />I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.<br /><br />Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review. MY ratings never remotely consider that factor, I rely to much on reviews from time to time when buying products to give something a positive rating because its free. However I  do consider the list price on amazon for some items to keep it all in context. For instance, you shouldn't expect a BMW for the price of a Chevy.<br /><br />If this review helped you , please click on the little link below, so i know i am hitting the things you need to know and that my reviews are helping people. Thankse distance.  and 3 touch buttons, 2 for volume up and down, and 1 to cycle between city modes and highway mode. ( i assume the different modes help to skip some false warnings.<br /><br />The speaking, if i caught it correctly said&#34; position ahead&#34; in an accented but clear English voice. By the point it had gone off i had decided music was more important, as i rarely excessively speed anyways (10 mph over on highway)<br /><br />I have only 3 slight reasons it loses a star. While it is at a great price, it is missing the detector-detector featured on the similar cost cobra unit, and the barrel power connector is almost 2x the length it needs to be, causing the silver barrel to stick out even when properly seated, messing up such a sleek appearance.  And lastly, the manual. I think that this manual is more of a generic manual that is sent with a few different models, and while not overly complicated to operate the manual almost makes it more confusing. I am fairly confident that the russian language manual is more detailed showing which bands are supported and what looks like what those bands would be.<br /><br />Still  dollar amount considered, i give this 4 stars.<br /><br />This was provided to me to sample and write an honest review.

I have used it now for about 3 weeks. I love having the functionality of an Android tablet in my head unit. I use my phone as a mobile hotspot so I can use Maps, Waze, Pandora, etc. UPDATE: the Wi-Fi functionality often does not work and for 5-10 minutes after start. Screen Mirroring DOES NOT WORK, and since this is the most advertised function, I was tempted to send it back (to China). I have tried connecting a Note 4, S3, Galaxy Tab, and Kindle Fire with no success. :( If I do get it to work I will update this. I am able to use my steering buttons. The functionality of the radio application is not user friendly and it sounds horrible for all but the strongest signal stations, but I don't use the radio much anyway. The boot up time is about 1-2 minutes and reconnecting the Wi-Fi connection each trip can be even slower. If I want to listen to Pandora on a 5 minute trip to the store, I will spend most of the route in silence trying to get it to start :( There is no included documentation. There is a pdf installed in the unit, but it is difficult to understand and of little use. I assume the advertised functionality of dimming the display when headlights are on would work if it were wired properly, but how to do so is not apparent. I have not figured out how to connect the old LCD that sits on top or if that would work. The USB flash drive is not limited to 16GB, I connected a 128 GB thumb drive with no problem. :) I have not found the advertised option of changing the 86 opening logo splash screen nor changing between 9 LED button lighting colors :(  Overall, I still like the functions that the stock radio doesn't have, but I am disappointed in the advertised functions that don't work.  Installation tips: 1) loosen the side brackets on the HU to allow the holes of the LCD module on top to align to the holes in the side brackets. 2) if the bottom of the unit does not sit flush intothe environmental control module below, you may have to (carefully) remove the while clips from your old unit to use in the GA5151.",2015-07-30

It was the only reasonable BT transmitter with digital/Toslink input which I needed to convert a TV's output to a BT signal (the TV, a Toshiba, does not have analog audio output, as odd as that seems). When I first tried to buy this item (the Andoer), Amazon said the soonest it would arrive was after I was to leave for the weekend (where the device was to be installed as part of a gift), for whatever reasons 2 day or 1 day prime shipping wasn't available.<br /><br />So I bought the seemingly identical item branded as &#34;LingsFire&#34; (at $5 more) because 2 day shipping was an option for that item. That unit arrived in 2 days (a day before leaving for the weekend), but the power supply didn't work (it put out 1.7V instead of the required 5V) and the device/box itself never powered-on even when used with a verified good power supply. So I started the return/refund process for that product (which perhaps coincidentally, appeared to have been previously opened and re-sealed/taped).<br /><br />I then searched again on Amazon and now free 1-day shipping was available for the Andoer-branded version of this device! So I purchased it and crossed my fingers. It arrived at 6pm the following day and we made the boat for our weekend trip where the device was to be installed along with a JBL Flip 2 speaker for my hard-of-hearing father to watch/hear the television without bothering everyone else in the house.<br /><br />I tested the new (Andoer) power-supply (it put out 5v) and device/unit quickly (the blue LED came on and blinked) and then packed it up along with the BT speaker for our trip.<br /><br />PAIRING:<br />I read the directions for both devices, but could not get them to pair. I sat and stared and read and re-read and tried different BT speakers. Finally, I decided to hold down the power button for like 10 seconds and finally the LED flashed quickly alternating between red and blue. *This* is the pairing mode. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode. Anyway, once I discovered this, it was smooth-sailing and everyone is very happy.<br /><br />I do wish there was less lag/latency however: there's really no way, at least with this TV, to eliminate the delay between the audio coming out of the TV's built-in speakers and those coming from the BT speaker. So we just disable or turn-down the TV's speakers, but that may not be an option for everyone.de. The slow blue blinking LED is *not* pairing mode.

Although it has a touchscreen, it had buttons too, which helped me avoid accidentally triggering unwanted touchscreen gestures. It supported organizing files into folders, like on the computer. It supported djvus, which I hdn't been able to open on my previous e-reader, and supported a wider range of pdfs. It didn't support all the accessibility options than Android KitKat devices are supposed to support, like disabling unwanted touchscreen gestures.  After 26 days, it stopped working. Unfortunately, there are a lot of bugs with their support website. I can't get a clear answer, and I can't file a rma request while the website's broken, but I think they want me to ship this to Eindhoven for repairs, and pay them to ship it back. That's more than $70 right there. This is less than one month old, and this is still under warranty. I still hope I can get this repaired, either under warranty or otherwise.  P.S. I got the website working, I should be able to get this repaired.  P.P.S. I got the authorization, all the information to send it in for repairs, mailed it, and due to yet another mix-up, they didn't accept it so it is being returned undelivered. *headdesk*",2015-07-29

As soon as I started playing a song I realized it lit up to the beat of the music. That was really neat! I stared at it for a minute and forgot what I was about to do for a second. I love that I can use this speaker while cleaning around the house. I can grab this and my phone and move from one room to the next easily. The speaker is very compact and lightweight and doesn't take up any space at all so I can put it on a shelf, dresser, or counter somewhere while I clean. The sound quality is actually really impressive for the size. There is no distortion and you can actually hear the bass coming from the song. You can also answer phone calls and use the speaker as a hands free speaker. The sound on the other end of a phone call is nice and clear as well. I had no problems hearing someone on the other end and they had no problems hearing me. I also like the fact that I can connect devices through an AUX cable or put a USB flash drive in the speaker to play music. It even has a built in antenna and radio!

So I will share it with you........ The power cord has 3 wires, (black) ground – (yellow) B+ and (Red) ACC. Then there is the other wire that is to connect the rear camera “a plug type of connection”.  The easiest way to connect the power in thru the fuse box.  The red and yellow wires are connected to 2 - 15amp fuses (1 on each wire) the yellow (B+) goes to a constant power supply. My Hazard lights use a 15amp fuse and it always has power whether or not the car is turned on, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the yellow wire. And the Red (ACC) needs a power source that shut off when the key is removed, so… my cigarette lighter will not work when the car is turned off and it uses a 15amp fuse, so I replaced the fuse already inserted in the cars fuse box with the fuse on the red wire. And the black (ground) connects to the metal frame…..anywhere is fine, but not connect to the fuse box………….just in case you come into contact with live wires. I haven’t tried to hook up the rear camera but I’m assuming that the red wire on the rear camera is to be hooked up to your back-up light, not sure didn’t do any research on it. The reason I didn’t give the product 5 stars is because I had to search the web to find out where the wires go, other than that…………..I love it, it works great…….once I got the power installed. :-)",2015-07-26

This ZEN was purchased after my original took an unfortunate two feet drop straight onto concrete while it was playing and died an instant, hopefully painless death. I attempted to repair the device afterward by purchasing and installing a new hard disc. Unfortunately this never ended up solving the problem, so after that 40 dollars thrown away I decided to purchase a refurbished model online.<br /><br />It came packaged in a smaller version of something like the original ZEN packaging. If you're like me, you could immediately tell it was refurbished because it had been super-glued shut somehow. I tried my damnedest to open up the case to try my hard disc in it, still trying to troubleshoot the old one and see if I had purchased a faulty disc or if it was some other issue with my original. No doing - it remained glued shut and I didn't want to press my luck, so I left it.<br /><br />Has all the design limitations and benefits as the original. Same wonderful weight in your hand, same easily manipulated interface, same software limitations (when I buy a new mp3, it's going to be able to play FLAC files). It's always had an average to good sound quality for what it is, and a massive amount of storage for everyone with massive music collections. This refurbished model seems to have a shorter battery life than my original, but not enough to complain about. Overall it's a fair purchase, and I expect it'll last me another several years before I replace it with some super new non-Apple product.",2015-07-25

They are perfect for using with a power bank (iXCC offers many kinds--check them out) or for using them with an action cam such as the SJ4000 (which I personally use them for). It is a basic microusb cable, theres nothing special about it other then it being super short! I have used this cable for a few weeks now and during that period it has endured numerous bends, pulls, drops, and baby slobber! The cable works just perfect. I appreciate iXCC not overdoing it with branding. While there is some branding they when with branding that blends in well. I applaud them for that.<br /><br />Speed wise its rated for up to 480mbps, pretty much the standard for usb cables so you will get your standard results.<br /><br />The quality is there like all other iXCC products. I was a bit worried about my 9 month olds slobber when she got ahold of it. I have had cables in the past either A) stop working or B) start messing up and then later corrode. She had this thing almost entirely in her mouth for a good 5 minutes (yes I know, bad parent.. I was busying looking on Amazon!) and once I pulled it out I just wiped it down with a baby wipe and let it dry.<br /><br />I would recommend this cable if you use power banks and your device accepts microUSB or if you own a goPro or action camera.

With items and walls blocking the connection you can't go quite as far but still a good distance.<br /><br />There is an on/off, play/pause/bluetooth, volume up, volume down buttons.One of the coolest features is that you can use this speaker with so many devices wether they are bluetooth or not. You can plug your phone or computer in using an auxiliary cord or you can even play music or files off of a micros card! This is awesome because you can load your music on to a card and this is one of the best portable speakers on the market for its' size!<br /><br />I haven't tried the microphone yet but I will update when I do.

The first the connector broke and the second I returned to Amazon because it could not be recogized as being plugged into my computer - the later I will explain ( please read).  Just returned from trip 7/21/15. On the way out I thought it did a better job of street names, etc than that garmins. Programing it for trips is pretty easy as well. I will say if you do not have the actual STREET address you have issues because its programed for STATE, CITY, STREET, ADDRESS. I did realize just today that you can go to POI and it list hotels and then you can just type in the hotel name for the city so that's cool. Easier to do on the Garmin's.  Pros: easy to program, Cheap, life time maps whatever that means.  Cons: this is the big negative for me. Street names. What good does it do to tell me the name when I'm in the turn? This past trip I missed a lot of turns because it did not announce the street name in advance. My Garmin's had a large box at the top of the screen showing the name of the street. This has a small box on the right that one has to seriously take there eyes off the road to read and for those two reasons I would not purchase this. The third reason was the graphic display. I spent a lifetime designing training materials and working in Powerpoint to create slides and I couldn't have chosen worse colors then they came up with. If you can see the cross streets your eyes are better than mine. Horrible washed out background.   Note: It did announce in advance major highways like ' turn left ahead on US 2 but not streets in towns. To be honest we just got smart phones and played with the GPS in our town and its no comparison to either the Garmin or Tom Tom. Need to find a bracket to hang it on then I'm done with both Garmin and Tom Tom.  Last: Both of my Garmins and my new Tom Tom were not recognized by computer as being plugged in thus, you cannot update maps or charge the darn thing. Found out how to get aroundit. You know this is a big issue when both companies have a page of instructions to try. My guess, MS doesn't like these new products and so there is a compatibility issue here.  1. Go into My Computer 2. Go into Devices 3. Find Tom Tom or your device name 4. Click on the Windows box and select 'activate or whatever the word is. This should now start the communication process.

Since it's small and portable, I am just beginning to find other way to use it.  Best 20 bucks I ever spent!",2015-07-22

Why do we spend so much on a device just to play music and look cool (or so we think looks cool). I am not one of these people. I value a good deal and good quality that is affordable. That is why I love the LiteXim mp3/mp4 player.<br />I was looking for something to listen to my audio books/files while in the car and running. This little device is PERFECT for what I need. Great Strong clip on the back allows me to clip it to my belt/shirt sleeve and start running getting lost in the music. It is easy to use with simple button feature. it comes with simple to read instructions, but playing around on it for a few minutes and I could use it with ease. It plays music files, video files, pictures, records and plays back recording, FM radio and even can save text type files.<br />For the price, your not going to beat this great little device. Well worth the price.",2015-07-22

The headphones did not work out of the box. I was not going to use them anyway but most people would be upset about that. The ipod coppied spinwheel is just for decorations you must click buttons to do anything. The instructions would be useless because there is so little to them and much is needed because despite having only 5 buttons navigating is confusing until you get the hang of it. However the instructions on the inside are just wrong. You might as well throw it away because it will be easier to figure out on your own. It will take time to figure all the options out too. Some buttons i cant even tell if they work or when they work. Navigating the different folders (bands/singers) is annoying and a crapshoot to find out if songs will replay over and over. I have found that starting from the beginning works well but if you want to skip a song you have to click the skip button for each song.<br />the pros...a 64gb mp3 player for under $30. The sound is average and the equalizer helps but if you are looking for premium sound this isnt it.<br />the setup to put music on from my wmp was quick and easy. I am not sure if i got an exclusive deal but for the money i paid and for what i use it for (at work where it can potentially break easily) it was a steal. If i compare it to the ipod that it is trying to copy then it is garbage.<br />my advice is if you dont mind figuring out menus then this is for you.

I spent about 10mn in the water with it during the day, swimming on the surface. At the end of the day, it wouldn't turn on.

Don't let that stop you from buying one though.  There is nothing similar as far as size/weight/2m and 440 from ICOM, Kenwood or Yaesu.  I wasn't expecting a whole lot for the price but as it turns out I really like it.  For a small car this is the perfect size (a bit bigger than a radar detector).  Mine puts out 25 watts towards the top of the 2m band and ~23 or 24 at the bottom (my meter is just a cheapo with a swing needle so not super accurate but good enough).  The low power setting doesn't seem to work, other reviews and youtube videos confirm this.  It would be nice to have the feature to save battery power and generate less heat.  Speaking of heat, it does get warm but nothing crazy.  Short repeater chats kept the temp on the heat sink at about 125 degrees (measured with a non-contact thermometer), rag chewing on simplex with another guy for an hour or more and the temp got to 140.  I think if you were going to do a bunch of simplex it might be good to stick a small fan on the heat sink but honestly it'll get hotter inside my car parked in the sun.  The mic is solid feeling and a very good copy of a Kenwood mic right down to the silk screening on the boards.  The key layout is different though.  Modulation is a little low but not terrible.  Better than the Baofeng HTs at least.  I haven't seen a pin out diagram for this mic yet but I might try swapping in another mic.  EDIT: Its a Kenwood pinout.    Sound is good but not great (its a pretty small speaker) but it does get nice and loud without becoming very distorted.  I think this would make it a nice choice for use in a soft top Jeep or other noisy cabin vehicle.  Some low reviews here because of programming issues.  If you have fooled around with a Baofeng or any of the other china radios you should be ok.  If your experience is only with the big 3 japanese manufacturers or you've never programmed a radio before fret not, the Miklor site has a good step by step to do it manually (this is the same radio as the QYT 8900).  Of note even if you set the offset you'll still need to punch in the tx freq as well.  I wouldn't suggest trying to punch in a repeater while driving (which I can easily do on my other radios) but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy to program all the local repeaters in there and be set.  It would not be my first choice for a long road trip for this reason.  I suspect that CHIRP will support it before too long (it is pretty new to the market after all). But even if they don't the factory software can be downloaded at the Miklor site.  Honestly if there was a Kewood or other big name radio with similar features/size/power output I would have bought that instead.  But I can't complain, the price is great and it works quite well.  I get great signal reports coupled with a 1/4 wave mag mount and the whole thing is easy to move around (rental car, truck driver etc etc).  73s",2015-07-19

Light as a feather, clipped it on my collar and had my music wherever I went. Then it started mysteriously turning itself off. At first I thought it had just run out of batteries, so I went home and charged it. It worked fine again for another few days, then the problem suddenly got really bad. I would turn the player on and it would load up the home screen, but as soon as I pressed ANY button, it would shut off. I also tried not pressing anything just to see what would happen: it consistently turned itself off after about 20 seconds. I also tried resetting the device and updating the firmware; no improvement.<br /><br />I checked some online forums, and found out that apparently this is a problem with all of the Sansa Clips. It's only a small percentage that have this problem, but if you happen to get one of the bad ones, there's nothing you can do. Even worse, it shows up at random times: some people had their Clip for months before it started malfunctioning. So if yours is working reliably now, that doesn't mean it will keep working in the future. This is all based on what they're saying in the forums; I don't know if it's totally accurate. All I know is my Clip+ became completely unusable after two weeks.<br /><br />Very annoying, but at least the seller gave me a full and timely refund. They didn't even ask me to ship the product back -- which I guess makes sense, since it's pretty much a paperweight at this point.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk.",2015-07-18

I bought this primarily as a companion for our camping trips and other outings with friends (beach, park days, hikes around the county).  My son is increasingly interested in music and sharing it with friends is one way he is expanding his ability to participate in social gatherings and up his comfort level considerably.  The sound of this speaker compared to a smaller one we have owned for awhile is night and day, and for a not significant increase in expense.  Sometimes it pays to be a little behind the curve in tech but this speaker appears to be solidly built and a good solution for adding a soundtrack to outings in semi-remote areas or even around the house.

It still try's to ask you for state when there are none.  And what I really did not like is that you have to enter the house number first, then the street then the city.  Well that's kinda backwards especially when countries are so close together.  Let's try the country first, then the city then the street.  All I know is that it was not straight forward. You have to go to the upper right corner and do a &#34; search near&#34; to get closer into the country before you can proceed.   Having said all that, the maps themselves were very accurate and the directions, once finally in there, were spot on. It was really very helpful.

Starting with the design, there is nothing intuitive about using this device. No matter how you're intending to get your music to the device (sd card, usb, bluteooth), ultimately the point is that it's going to be playing through your radio, so the FM setup is key. This is really tricky to configure and takes a while to get used to. The current station is not displayed, rather you get a really helpful &#34;bt&#34; or &#34;hi&#34; displayed. What station am I on? &#34;bt&#34; Cool. To change the station, or even see the station, you have to press and hold the button on the right. This will not just display but will move the station up 1. If you want to move the station down, you have to hold the button on the right, moving it up one, then quickly use the left button to move the station down before it goes back to the helpful &#34;bt&#34; display. Long press the left button to move it down? Nope. That's just short press (again, only after long pressing the right button.)<br /><br />Several red lights run and cyclists ran over later, I at least had figured out  how to get it to the right station. The pros, well the sound is about as good as you can expect from these types of devices, I've used worse so that was nice. However, and what I'm most disappointed about, is that once you overcome the poor design, the device just doesn't work. The bluetooth connection breaks on average of once per album. On a ten hour road trip, probably 7 or 8 times the music just stopped randomly, and I had to turn it off, turn it back on again, and connect the bluetooth. Again, all things you want to be doing while driving.",2015-07-17

However I ran into a number of technical issues which detract from what could have been a nice dash cam.<br /><br />The first unit I received could not advance past the \\""welcome\\"" page.  The return and replacement was easy as anything on Amazon.<br />The second unit records without problems, however many of the files on the micro sd are not viewable. The error reads \\""The format of xxx.mov cannot be detected.\\""  This is a serious problem because unlike many cameras that save small files often this camera saves large files, so if something goes wrong when it saves the entire recording sessions is lost.<br /><br />By trial and error I determined the video files are not saved correctly related to how the dash cam is stopped.  It appears that if I disconnect USB power and let it run for a few minutes on internal battery until it runs out of juice it saves the file the file is saved fine and they can be played back.  However if I stop recording by just turning off ignition in the car (which is what I have always done with the other dash cams) the file is not saved properly and is corrupted. I also was not able to read the file when I used on/off button to turn off the unit itself prior to turning off ignition.<br /><br />On the positive side:<br /><br />✔ Video quality of the dash cam is quite good as you can see in attached video.<br />✔ This camera has an excellent suction cup mount, stayed on even on rough roads.<br />✔ The dash cam uses standard micro USB cables.<br />✔ The cam has an LED display so I can tell that the cam is aimed correctly.  The display flashes a bit as you drive, I have not seen this with the older dash cams we own.<br />✔ Recording starts as soon as it gets power so you don't have to remember to turn it on.<br /><br />The AmorTek package includes the camera, two mini USB cables, and cigarette lighter USB adapter.<br /><br />The user interface is straightforward and even though the manual does not contain details for each button and each option, it contains a picture where each button's function is labelled. I found the manual sufficient to configure my video cam. All defaults are reasonable.<br /><br />Overall, this dash cam has good potential but appears to be an early version which still has some technical issues to iron out especially with reliable saving of files.<br /><br />This video cam is provided by AmorTek.

The price was right for this item so I purchased it.<br /><br />First off, a few tools are helpful.  I found that a metric tape measure, soldering gun, round file, fish tape and cable ties made the job much neater and professional looking.<br /><br />The included instruction sheet is worth looking at even though you can install the system without it. There are optimal height and spacing recommendations as well as an acceptable range between the sensors listed on the sheet. I was able to get the height perfect but the spacing between the sensors was just not possible on the Escape. Reinforcements and brackets on the back of the plastic bumper cover were in the way so I had to compromise. I have a little bit of a blind spot if there is something like a pole or other thin vertical item centered behind me. Since I mounted the display on top of the rear view mirror that should not be too much of an issue as I can use the mirror and display together.<br /><br />To start the installation I laid everything out in the back of the SUV, connected all sensor and display cables and spliced the power wire into the backup light to test the system. Note I did not cut the vehicle wire but shaved off a quarter inch of the insulation, separated the strands of both wires, fed and twisted the power wire through the shaved section and soldered the power wire in. Very sleek and secure. A couple of weeks after doing this I found some Scotchlok T-Tap terminals just made for splicing inline. I will use them when I wire up my trailer hitch.<br /><br />Next I put some blue painter's tape on the bumper and experimented with the layout of the sensors. This took much longer than I anticipated but I wanted it to be as functional and good looking as possible.<br /><br />When I was happy with the layout I drilled pilot holes in the plastic and then used the hole saw (included with the kit) to make the holes. Drilling in plastic is easy and it's important to drill slowly. Plastic can melt fairly quickly if the hole saw gets hot. The tape was removed before drilling with the hole saw. You want the holes to be nice and neat because the sensors don't have a lot of play in the mount. A fine round file cleaned up the burrs left behind from the hole saw.<br /><br />The sensors were mounted in the plastic and I started feeding the wires from the driver's side over to the passenger side where I planned on running the wires up into the interior. Cable ties were used to keep things neat. A little extra care had to be taken on the passenger side because of the muffler. Not too difficult, but no sense melting anything.<br /><br />The wires were fed up through a vent which is where I wanted to mount the control box. That was not bad.<br /><br />I drove it like this for a week before attempting to mount the display. I really wanted it above the mirror which meant running the wire above the headliner but thought it would be too difficult. In reality it was a piece of cake. I dropped the interior lights and the sunglass holder and fed the fish tape through one section at a time starting at the front. The only difficult part was from the rear-most light down the corner of the passenger side but even that took maybe 5 minutes.<br /><br />If I was going to complain about anything my rear view mirror has a slight curve to it. The display does not. There is a very slight gap between the two on one end but the double-sided tape still feels secure. Hopefully it will hold up over time.<br /><br />All in all I am happy with the outcome and would purchase this again if my next vehicle needs one.<br /><br />Note: One thing I have not seen mentioned anywhere is there is an on/off switch located on top of the display.

Purchase this product as a way to carry radios in the field hunting. I am an avid archery hunter and backpacker. This product is built in such a way that it will attache in almost any way you can find a place to attache it to a backpack (hunting pack, day pack, overnight pack). As a radio holder it works with almost any radio on the market today. I happen to have both uniden's and Motorola's. It will hold GPS's and anything else you can fit into it because of it's design. HERE IS THE TRUE ULTIMATE USE FOR THIS POUCH. I carry a firearm with me in the field at all times. If Im going lightweight and don't want a heavy weapon such as overnight backpack trips with the family and just need a firearm to scare a bear or ward off a coyote or cougar I will carry my S&W m&p .22lr compact single stack. If I am in need of a bigger cal. I will carry my S&W m&p 9mm compact. (No I don't want to get in a gun debate about what to carry or any of that crap). Those happen to be my two weapons of choice for my own personal reasons. THIS POUCH FITS BOTH WEAPONS EITHER MOUNTED TO THE HIP OF A PACK OR A SHOULDER STRAP NEAR YOUR CHEST. Both weapons fit perfectly and I would suspect any semi auto compact firearm would also fit very similar. I carry my .22 attached to my shoulder strap on my backpack and it's right at my chest ready to go. While hunting I carry my nine on my hip just incase I ever need it. Out of shear dumb luck I was experimenting with this and figured it out. WORKS AWESOME! One of the photos is my .22 and the other is whith my 9mm.",2015-07-17

Only hope now is that Toyota keymaker gadget, (another $15 on Amazon), works to make this more than an expensive door opening key.<br />Edit: 7/31/15: After re-reading the stated facts, it does plainly tell you that you will need to have this key cut and programmed at an automotive locksmith, so it does not provide onboard programming, at least for my model truck.

Once forgot to charge it (needs charging about once every 3 weeks),  and the batt went dead, dead, with watch face totally blank.  It charged right back up again,  just fine.<br /><br />You truly are buying a watch with quality and efficiency.  And did I mention it keeps on-the-dot time too?  LOVE THIS PURCHASE!",2015-08-30

As I age, I have concerns about maintaining a youthful level of testosterone. While I do not suffer from ED or low libido, there are many other reasons that men would want to insure adequate and healthy testosterone production, muscle-body fat ratio, bone density, brain health, etc. One of the drawbacks to many low-T therapies is hair loss. When I looked at the list of ingredients in this product I saw “pumpkin seed powder” which helps prevent the conversion of testosterone to DHT which contributes to hair loss. I looked at the other ingredients and was familiar nearly all the ingredients, having most of them already in my vitamin cabinet in some form or another. Based on that I figured I would give this product a try. The first day I took the product, within hours I felt like I’d swallowed a fistful of guarana capsules - I was zooming. I did not think much about it or even relate it to taking the product. By day 4 I became alarmed as I nearly no sleep for the previous three nights. I went back to ingredients list of the product and saw a name I did not recognize, Tongkat Ali - the main ingredient. I googled side effects for Tongkat Ali (which goes by many different names) and found it under the name EURYCOMA LONGIFOLIA on WebMD. While there was nothing to suggest that there is anything wrong with using the herb, I did read that sleeplessness is one possible side effect. I went back to the product bottle, and it is listed there as a reason to discontinue use, I immediately stopped taking it for the rest of the week. I decided I would start again in one week, but drop the dose to half, a single pill per day and see if that would be different. Unfortunately I had the same speedy, sleepless reaction to even half a dose. While I can find nothing wrong with the product or its ingredients via Google searches, it seems like it may not be for people like me who are highly reactive to drug in general. And like any supplement, read the warning label on the product before using.",2015-08-29

When applying this product you notice that the consistency isn't like your typical cream, but it goes on the skin like butter, gliding through nicely.  It also absorbs well into the skin keeping it hydrated.  The reason that I give this product a 4 is because I felt that it didn't really hydrate my skin for 8-12 hours like it says on the description.  I felt that I kept having to reapply the cream multiple times per day, and because of this I ran out of the product quickly. The redness from my eczema was more calm after using this product, however, I still shed flakes due to my dry skin on my face, so like I said before I found myself having to reapply the cream, and I have been using this product for 3 weeks now.

Healtier than Cocoa,"I have seen cacao my entire life and have bought it for recipes but never thought there was any difference. There is a big difference and there's not much of a difference. From what I read. The Cacao Bean and Coco Bean are one in the same.. It's all in the way its processed and if its processed. Cacao is the purest form of chocolate. They think that cacao has the highest of magnesium and antioxidants , high in fiber and many other healthy attribute. Even though Cocoa is possessed at a higher heat and from a different part of the some bean as cacao, it still retains a huge amount of the same nutritional values.  I haven't had the chance to make any recipes that allow the cacao.  but I have added it to a few things that really set it off.. We made brownies the other night and added  bit to those.. It made them super, super chocolaty. I also took a que from a website where I learned about the beans where it was talking about making adding it to coffee.. I added a heaping spoonful to my coffee that I brewed in my french press. It was a bit too chocolaty, so the next one I added half a spoonful. Perfect.. I add creamer and sugar to my coffee, so it turned it into the perfect mocha, just right…. YUM! I will be using cacao instead of coco from now on. I use a lot of coconut oil, agave nectar , coconut flour etc , so this actually fits perfectly with the ingredients I already have in my pantry. Im at the tipping point age, so every bit helps keep me from tilting too far in the wrong direction and it helps me keep start my kids off right, teaching them how to eat healthy and know why they eat what they eat   DISCLAIMER :  My No Nonsense Thoughts: I could reiterate what is in the description above, but  you've  most likely already read it.

It comes packaged in a convenient box that you open like you would a standard kleenex book so that you can pull the pieces out one at a time.  There is a stiff piece on the end for the purpose of threading the floss through the teeth. Is is followed by another approximate 6&#34; section that is thicker and fluffy to clean out wider areas or in my case, the area above the middle tooth in the bridge. This is followed by a very long piece of standard floss which is still a little thicker and ropier than the oral B floss I am used to using. The floss is excessively long in my opinion and although it works very well on my bridge, I find that the floss part itself is too thick for the rest of my mouth which means that I am only using about 1/3 of each piece.

I was worried they may be flat like other brands I have purchased but the pouch and cardboard box they were shipped in really protected them. The colors are bright are perfect to match a little girl's wardrobe. I love how they can be used in casual or dressy outfits. The satin flowers aren't just a one piece pressed flower, it is several small pleats that give it more volume and depth. We have tried both single bows as well as making combinations with them. The clips are alligator style clips that hold well in my daughter's fine hair. They do not seem to poke her head or pull her hair.

I have seen the price on these clones anywhere form $41 to $100 for the entire unit.<br /><br />So I would really check out the costs to make sure your not paying top dollar for your device.<br />What I like about it:<br />It's built very well and seems like it could survive a accidental drop<br />It has a huge tank that's simple to fill once you check out a youtube video to learn how if your new to these devices.<br />Huge powerful battery, with 4 different output voltages that allow larger hits if that what you want.<br />Charges fully in about 4 hours.<br />Does not leak any juice into your mouth which really is gross!<br />Seems like it will last a long time with a replaceable battery.<br />Has a optional LED flashlight that can be added to the battery for a very powerful flashlight.<br />Can add any 510 thread tank!<br />Has a two color battery power indicator that cheaper vaps do not have. This one will light up white with a full charge and light up blue when the charge is in the 30% left range. (Great feature that I have not seen on my friends $35 unit)<br />On/Off is as simple as pushing the power button 5 times within two seconds and it works well.<br /><br />Seeing that this is my first purchase of a vap device that I use for nicotine addiction I'm smoking less real cigs from 2 packs a day down to one.<br /><br />This for me is going to hopefully help me quit smoking all together. However, in the mean time this will give me the hand to mouth addiction in a way that does not harm my lungs like real smoke will.<br /><br />If you want a good vapor pen this is a really good one and my best friend who has bought several of these is now buying this one based on how great it is. So the experience I lack is made up with my friends and he thinks this is a excellent vapor device and will be buying one very soon.",2015-08-25

These are the cutest and the just the perfect sized clips I ever purchased for my little gal! Love love love the awesome colors that the clips come in. These clips came in a very smart and translucent zip pouch, perfect for storing the clips especially if you are short on storage space. These clips are perfect for small babies. I stumbled upon these clips as I have a 9 month old who has yummy hair which keeps sliding over her eyes. I love her hair and did not want to trim it, also, I do not want it getting in the way while she is busy getting the hand of crawling all over the house. A few things I loved about these clips are that the flowers are made with a very high quality satin ribbon. The material used in making the flowers and the use of vibrant colors ensures the classic look of these clips! The small pearl stuck to the center of the flower just takes the brilliance of these clips to another level. What I really liked about the clips was the fact that part of the clips, the top part and the actual part where you hold the clip to put on or take off is also covered in a ribbon of the same color as the flowers giving the clip a finished classy look. Also, the ribbon where you hold the clip is textured to ensure ease of use and prevents the clip from accidentally sliding off from your hands while you are attempting to put it on or take it off! Very thoughtful indeed! The clip itself is not an alligator clip and at times slides off if not put on correctly, but would I rather it slide off than cling on to a few strands of dear daughters hair and put her in pain. All in all, I love the range of colors and the quality of clips and I am sure that they will last us a long while! I will definitely return to purchase more if the need arises! Disclaimer: I was one of the lucky few who was able to get an opportunity to purchase the clips at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. Yay for that! Please comment with any questions you may have that I can help with. If you do find this review helpful please let me know!",2015-08-24

I got it a week before we moved across the country, and with all the expenses of the move we couldn't afford to send me for a professional massage. However, this stick helped immensely as a substitute. You wouldn't think a stick could help much, but it really does. The rollers on it have some ridges, which allow for extra pressure points to be hit. The handles have grips for easy handling, both by yourself or by someone using it on you. It's a very basic concept. You roll it up and down the sore area, adjusting the pressure as desired. Simple, yet effective. A lot of areas you can use this on yourself, but for your back and stuff it's more effective  for someone else to help you out. This is a great product that will bring you muscle tension relief! Note: Item sent at no cost to me to test and provide a review.",2015-08-23
US,18855428,R1WHQFYZWXP2DS,B00NU6H3PQ,915831084,Taylor Bluetooth Body Fat Smart Scale w/ 400 lb Capacity and SmarTrack App,Personal_Care_Appliances,3,5,6,N,N,Taylor Bluetooth Body Fat Scale w/ SmarTrack App,"I've covered a couple of different bathroom scales on here, and most of them have been fairly basic. I have one from Ozeri that measures body fat, bone, muscle and water levels too. I'm very happy with it. One even had it's own &#34;app&#34;. But until now, I'd not had one with bluetooth. In steps Taylor, a Salter Housewares brand, with their Taylor Smart Scale with Bluetooth, model 7222F.<br /><br />It has the fairly standard tempered glass surface, this time with stainless steel strips inlaid for the measuring of all those extra metrics like body fat, body water and muscle mass. And it then beams those numbers via bluetooth to your paired smartphone or tablet via their SmarTrack app. At least in theory, that is, because I could not get the app to register me, despite multiple tries on my phone, tablet, and over both our FiOS wifi and 4G network connection. Which, essentially, renders the features that most folks paid extra for useless. Shame. The idea behind easy and convenient tracking of your weight, and your fitness, is a good one, but one of these days these companies really need to understand app development and that it's more than throwing a few dollars at an IT company that bid the lowest to cobble together what amounts to placeholder to be able to say you &#34;have an app&#34;. It has to work, people.<br /><br />Okay. Deep breath.<br /><br />Aside from the incredible amount of frustration caused by this, the scale in and of itself is accurate, and while the numbers were slightly off from the other body fat-measuring scales we have here in the house, that can simply be chalked up to the fact that they all use &#34;estimates&#34; from small electrical signals sent through the body, and so many factors can skew that, I'm not going to begrudge a scale a few percentage points here and there. Up to 8 people can use this scale with basic non-bluetooth tracking features, an &#34;athlete&#34; setting for those that work out regularly, and a bright, dual-line backlit LCD readout with &#34;touchscreen&#34; controls. All this and it operates on 3 AAA batteries. Unfortunately, most of the advertised features like true tracking, cloud storage, and compatibility with MapMyFitness, RunKeeper and other popular apps are inaccessible due to the native app being useless. So it quickly becomes less and less a value because, let's face it, you paid for those features. I wanted to like this product so much more, and I've had Taylor, Salter, and Homedics scales before that were fantastic. This scale is, as a scale, flawless. It's all the advertised extras that caused the premium pricetag that are rendered useless by a non-functioning, junk app. For that reason, I find that I can't, at full retail, recommend this product, because so many of the potentially wonderful features advertised cannot be accessed, and they're built into the price tag. Too bad.<br /><br />I received the above product(s) free of charge from Taylor Precision Products.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,1,1,N,Y,So very pleased!  Worked very well.,"The short story - This worked remarkably well for clearing a nasty case of eczema.<br /><br />The long story - For the past three and a half years I have been battling a particularly stubborn case of eczema on my hands.  It's always hard when it's on your hands because every day tasks become tortuously painful due to all the splits in your skin that develop.  I like to use natural cures, when possible, and had tried various things like coconut oil and an elimination diet (I had hopes of identifying something that I was eating that might be causing the problem.)  No real, lasting help came from any of those.  In desperation, I finally sought out a dermatologist who immediately wanted to give me the dreaded steroid shot.  I declined that so she gave me clobetasol propitiante.  This was a very expensive ointment and while it did help to knock the eczema back somewhat, it failed to completely clear it and it would always come roaring back after I stopped using it.  (I was only allowed to use it for 14 days, maximum.)  The last time I went to refill the prescription, the druggest said it would cost $200 for a tube.  Knowing that it would provide only partial and temporary relief, I decided to come to amazon instead and see if I could find anything that was getting good reviews.  Fortunately, I found e-ra oranics Relief.<br /><br />I started using it and the less damaged areas of my hands began to show improvement within just a few days.  I was surprised, but cautiously optimistic.  I continued to use it for several weeks, continuing to see improvement.  However, there was one particularly stubborn area on the outer edge of my hand and in toward my palm that just would not budge.  It had several splits and even when I babied it and kept it covered as much as possible, it just continued to split open on me day after day.  I wondered if I'd ever see improvement.  I knew if I could just get it to stop breaking open like that, I'd be able to improve.  I continued applying the era organics Relief, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.  My hands are now about 98% normal, and that has been after nearly 3 1/2 years of constant torment.<br /><br />I'm on my fourth jar, but even at that I've only spent half of what that prescription would have cost me AND, the most important thing, I actually have been healed.  I'm so thankful and so amazed.  If you have ever had a severe attack of eczema, you know how miserable the itch is.  Sometimes it feels like you'll lose your mind scratching to stop the itch.  And then of course, all that scratching just damages your skin even more.  Then, as I said, there are the painful splits that make every day tasks like washing your hands a painful proposition.  My fingers had actually curled in somewhat, like claws.  It was BAD.  And it had made my life pretty miserable for a very long time.  So I can't thank the folks at Era Organics enough.  I will continue using this until I'm 100% healed and I will always keep some on hand, should a rash try to creep back.<br /><br />Btw, I very much like the feel of the cream.  It has a silky quality and is not greasy at all.<br /><br />If you or someone you love suffers with eczema, please give this a try and leave a comment in reply to my post to let me know how it helped you.<br /><br />In addition, I'd like to suggest anybody with a child or who is themself dealing with eczema read a very informative book by Dr. William Crook called, The Yeast Connection.  Between those two sources, you ought to find some relief.  Good luck!, and finally!  It healed enough that the skin stopped breaking open in splits.

But not great.,"At this point, 4 stars is the best that I can give any of these CPAP masks, and I give this one 3 stars. I have tried 2 different masks, plus the nasal pillow air delivery system. The nasal pillows has been my least favorite. I require a CPAP machine since I have serious nasal congestion. This results in loud snoring through both my mouth and my nose (with my mouth closed), plus I often stop breathing entirely for long periods while sleeping. (Interestingly enough, I feel more rested in the morning without the CPAP machine. But I am required to use it most of the time.)<br /><br />This is a three piece mask. The plastic frame, plus the plastic mask itself, and the cushion around the mask. All three pieces are together in this kit. The harness is extra. The recommended head harness for this mask works, but does not fit a person's head perfectly when using this mask.<br /><br />I need the large mask since my nostrils will sometimes close up while I sleep and I will start breathing through my mouth. This allows my mouth to breath air in/out below the length of a regular normal size mask. I have the large size of this mask, which is what I needed.<br /><br />However, here is the problem that I sometimes run into with this mask. The mask will marginally slip to one side and escaping air will dry out one of my eyes. This results in a very bad day for that eye for most of that day. Occasionally an eye wash will help with this, but not always. (A condition that I am experiencing as I type this review.)<br /><br />As I said, I have not found the perfect CPAP mask yet. And this mask is OK on most days. But waking up to dry eye can sometimes mean a bad day for that eye all day.",2015-08-22

I found it nice and appealing until i tried to open it.  I had a very hard time peeling the plastic off. Took me a while to open and that was frustrating.  I do like that it is sealed well though to prevent contamination.  The case the floss is in is very nice i love the shape and color reminds me of a bright white tooth. Just what i want to be visualizing while getting ready to floss.  The case was easy to click open, which was great considering some other brands are very difficult to open.  I hate breaking nails trying to open packaging.  The smell of this floss is very pleasant not too strong and over powering, just the right amount of mintiness.  Pulling the floss out of the case was a little difficult the wheel was sticking and was hard to pull the floss out without a bit of effort.  I might have gotten a defective one though.  When i got the floss out it was very nice and ribbon like.  I also love how it stretches, because i hate when floss breaks when flossing and this will help prevent it.  Flossing with this was a breeze.  I have a few crowns and floss always gets stuck under them this got under them without getting stuck but still cleaning that area well.  I love how it just glides between my teeth without me tugging and puling and breaking the floss.  I only need one string of floss to get through my entire mouth!  My 7yr old son also tried it out and loved the taste and it was easy for him to maneuver throughout his mouth without a problem as well.  He said you guys need to make floss stick with this floss because he likes it so much!  Overall it's a great floss just need to fix some of the packaging issue.  My 5 stars is based on the floss only and not the packaging<br /><br />I like the floss could do without the packaging problems though",2015-08-21

I was ecstatic to find this as my big toes are turning in and cutting into the toe next to them. I NEED something to cushion between and this seemed ideal. When I got them, it was a good thing, I thought. However, today one of them broke--the area where the &#34;pillow&#34; is attached to the rest of the product is simply too thin and can't hold up to the use it is supposedly designed for. No nail was cutting in to that area if you are trying to visualize this. If the product were not this pricey, it might be worth it, but $12 x 10 replacements a year is too much and I fear this is the amount of use someone who really needs the product will get out of it. I am not an athlete, nails are well trimmed, I don't wear tight shoes or high heels--this got as light of use as anyone designing it had a right to expect. I expected it to last a year.

I bought this on a fluke, fully expecting any &#34;Seen On TV&#34; product to last 5 minutes and break.<br />I was very wrong; this thing is great... it sanded/ground down a PILE of dead skin from the callus before pain in hip got to much to bare and quit for the day.  The difference was shocking.. it went from rough and hard.. catching on carpets, derned SOCKS!! and sheets to smooth as could be (used both rollers - oddly enough, mine was made without the brush for some reason - lucky me!)<br />Today, I pulled the bad leg up and under the other so I could more readily reach the underside. I got at LEAST the same amount off as yesterday and now... my foot feels completely different. It is truly an amazing product and thank whoever the hell made it!  I had actually used a stone bit in a Dremel before to smooth out bad toenail cuts.. these stones seem to be sturdy, too.  Not sure why people are talking about needed a replacement... seriously wth are you using it on?!? I bet I did the usage that a normal person would need a YEAR to duplicate and there's zero ware on the stones.  Also, the heads on the unit are a &#34;snap&#34; to switch out.

This is a great alternative pain reliever. My husband really likes it.<br /><br />I think the only improvement would be if they could make this larger sized self massager fold up. It's pretty big, but its so that you can get the right leverage on the trigger points. The only issue is &#34;where do I put this thing?&#34; It doesn't really have a storage option since it doesn't fold. Right now ours just lays around the house, but I dislike that and would prefer to find a place for it to live. If it folded up that would be even better. Folded in half it would easily fit under a sink or in a closet when not in use.<br /><br />Of course if you're constantly needing to use a self massaging tool like this for pain relief then you may not find it necessary to have it folded up when not in use. It really is a very 'handy' item to have around.<br /><br />Im a massage addict and sometimes my family gets sick of giving me back rubs, so then I have to resort to my own methods and this seems to do the trick for those times when I really need a muscle released.",2015-08-19

Turns out, the relaxin hormone  during my pregnancy was causing me a lot of pain sitting and walking. It got so bad that I started limping and after seeing a PT for a few months, he suggested I try this belt. He had warned me that breastfeeding would continue to cause my body to produce relaxin hormones, so I was prepared for the pain to come and go. Turns out, my son is now 17 months and the pain is back with a vengeance. There were times that sitting at work was very difficult, so I decided to purchase the belt and give it a try. I am SO ELATED that I did!! I wore it for at least 10 hours on the first day and when I went to bed at night, I felt so much better. The next day, I was literally pain free. On the third day, I did not wear my belt and I could feel the pain creeping back. I am happily wearing my belt now and will continue to wear it to keep the pain at bay. I will update my review after I have worn this for a longer period of time.",2015-08-18

The set is exactly what you expect to get - 6 dilators, the handle, the bag, and some small sample lubricant. The quality of the dilators won't blow your mind; they're made out of a sturdy plastic. Fortunately, there are no seams on the dilators, so no worries about sharp edges. Unfortunately, the plastic tends to made loud clanking noises in the bag, which ruins most attempts to be discrete. They don't stack into each other perfectly to fix this, so you might find yourself packing some loose material into the storage back to prevent the dilators from clanking. Certainly a minor issue, but could be annoying for some.<br /><br />They're not expandable, but I believe that 6 is a good balance for gradual increase in diameter. The user must take responsibility to use them gradually and consistently, and that's how it should be. This will be a simple and effective tool for those who want to work on stretching out, but haven't had much success with fingers / vibrators after several attempts.

The thing that drew me to this diffuser the most was the fact that it holds 300ml of water, rather than only 125ml that the diffuser in my &#34;to be un-named oil distributor&#34; kit came with, that one runs out of water within a few hours & it's been annoying me to have to keep refilling it all the time, the URPOWER diffuser runs for hours on end without needing a refill, almost the whole night through. I LOVE that it has a mist opening on one side of the top of the unit instead of just coming out the top in the middle so that I can direct it off the edge of the dresser that I have it on, the other one I have the mist comes out the middle & I'm always worried about the wood getting ruined, with this one I don't have that problem. It runs fairly quietly & I like the color options on it & that I can turn them off also when I don't want the mood lighting. Another nice feature is that it has several time options to chose from or you can just set it to run (which is what I do most of the time) because it automatically turns off.<br /><br />I did take off one star for a few minor things that if changed would have made this perfect for me:<br />1) it does beep when it shuts off, which isn't too loud & hasn't really annoyed me yet but if you use it at night & are a light sleeper it might be enough to wake you<br />2) it is kind of stiff to put the lid on correctly, the lid fits over the base with water just fine but once you have it on it takes a bit more force than I think it should to try to get the arrows to line up at the bottom, it's gotten stuck a few times & it's been difficult to try to adjust while also trying not to slosh water around the inside.<br /><br />All in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!in all though I like this diffuser way better than the other one that we have and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a larger volume diffuser!",2015-08-17

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,0,1,N,Y,Really Great Cream for All Skin Types/Issues,"My daughter just started getting eczema so we've been looking for a cream that will soothe the irritated areas. This cream seems to do that - not as well as the prescription stuff, but this does work. I like how natural the ingredients are. It absorbs quickly, takes the scaliness away (with multiple uses), and feels good on the skin. I don't have eczema, but we live in an extremely dry climate which makes daily application of lotion a necessity. I prefer this cream to the big name brands I've used for years - the scent isn't overpowering and it's moisturizing without being greasy.<br /><br />I also like that Era Organics is a family owned company - they seem to care about their customers and they want you to like the product. They are open to answering questions and listen to your feedback. You really have nothing to lose with their 60 day money back guarantee. This is such a nice moisturizer that I can't imagine many people return it due to dissatisfaction with the results. My daughter and I have very different skin - and we're both very happy with it! Yes, it's a little on the expensive side, but the container is a good size. You don't need to use gobs of the cream to get results, and from what I've read, the ingredients are much higher quality than most drugstore brands.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Great stuff for the skin. It's long lasting, feels good, and the ingredients are soothing. Whether you have eczema, overly dry skin, some other various skin condition, or healthy skin you just want to keep moist and healthy, give this a try. I bet you'll be as happy with it as we are!",2015-08-17

It just conked out on me recently, so I'd say I got a pretty good use out of it. Does the job and pulls out every hair efficiently. However you do have to play around with which way you're stroking the surface of your skin as hair tends to grow out in different ways. I have coarse black hair and it pulls it out well. I've used this on ever part of my body where hair is unwanted (legs, underarms, arms, bikini line). Goes without saying that it WILL hurt the most for the first time, but if you have a high tolerance for pain I would highly recommend it. I don't like shaving or waxing but epilating is great and the rate of hair regrowth is slower. Hair grows back tapered so you won't look like a Yeti after a few days. I've also noticed that my hair grows back in patches because some old hair never grew back. So if you're some type of hair removal masochist, this item is for you.",2015-08-16

Originally introduced to this product by a plastic surgeon who said that it prevents scars from forming when you get a scrape.( I had a really scraped knee). Initially developed as thick foam gel bandage to be used on burn victims.  The idea is that you put it on and it seals out the air so no scab forms, thus no scar when healed.  Underneath the bandage,  new soft skin is growing.  The clear oozing  is normal part of the healing process.. Leave bandage on so the new skin can grow.  Change only when the oozing gets too much and flows out of the perimeter of the bandage or at least every other day.  Make sure the bandage is large enough  to extend around the wound itself  and leave extra to catch the oozing and I cut it in a circle so there are no edges to start to peel away.  No pain when pulling it off and not even  painful while on. I would put a new one on after shower.  Because these are quite expensive, I would only use these on the body parts where I did not want an ugly scar to form.",2015-08-16

Initially I turned the bottom part several times until the bleach reached the tip of the brush.  Then I simply put a thin layer on each tooth in my mouth. I turned the bottom of the pen a bit to get enough bleach for each tooth.  I also made sure to swipe between each tooth.  It only took a minute or two. The brush attachment is the easiest one I've ever used over the years.  It is soft, yet firm enough that applying is a piece of cake.  The instructions say to brush your teeth and floss before using, but I typically don't do that.  I just brush it on when I think of it about once a day.  You're not supposed to swallow it, but I don't see how that can be avoided to some extent.  About 20 minutes later, I rinse my mouth out and I'm done.  The taste isn't peppermint and one time I breathed in as I swiped a front tooth and it felt like I was breathing in weak ammonia.  But overall the taste is tolerable.  I have already been using another brand prior to getting this pen.  It is the CVS brand that comes in a container much like nail polish with a brush attached to the lid.  I like that one too, but this pen is much easier to use.  After 2 uses, I noticed a fairly significant whitening effect despite my prior daily use with the CVS stuff over the last month.  This leads me to believe the Smilebriter is a more effective bleaching option.  I'm very pleased with these pens (2) and once they are gone, I'll definitely order more.",2015-08-15

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,0,0,N,Y,Amazing for sensitive rocasea prone skin,"Well, at first I was sort of lost. I tried many different moisturizers and they all just seemed burnt my face due to its hypersensitive irritation from topical retinoids prescribed by my dermatologist. Thus, I was stuck with red, painful, peeling skin, as a result, and it was NOT a fun experience.  I thought to myself &#34;why not try something natural to combat something unnatural?&#34; Because natural things might not cause all of this pain; and I swear if I put anymore chemicals on my face it was going to explode.. That's when I found this moisturizer. Just overnight, I noticed drastic changes in my chemically enduced flare ups and dryness. I was quite impressed, and my face was left supple and moisturized. As for application, it does go on sort of thick, what surprised me the most was how fast it absorbed; and it soaked in without leaving an oily/greasy residue (huge plus) a little DOES go a long way. I suggest using about a dime sized amount for your entire face, after washing with a sensitive Ph balanced cleanser that works for you. It really does work, and helps relieve the redness very quickly, and it leaves your skin perfectly moisturized! As for the owner, he is extremely motivated to create the best buying experience you can get; he is very prompt at replying, and is very resourceful! He will always make sure you're a happy costumer, so in my opinion no matter what, it's worth a try to get this moisturizer! If you don't like it for any reason, just message him and he will give you a full refund.  Best of luck to all those with sensitive skin! There is hope.  Jacob B.",2015-08-14

If properly sized this pillow works fantastic.<br /><br />Having suffered some neck issues after playing years of football in my earlier days, I found that normal pillows would ultimately lead to next day stiffness, aches and waking up with my arms being numb.  These can all be signs that your pillow, not your mattress needs to be addressed.  Being an experienced user of this product, I can say there was a bit of a learning curve in using this pillow, take several days to adjust to, and the biggest bit of advise I can give you is.....SIZE DOES MATTER!<br /><br />Although measuring according to Therapeutica's sizing guide for my first pillow, I found the first pillow did not work well for me on our normal pillow top, but worked GREAT on our firmer day bed that I will also sleep on.  See, the sizing guide does not factor in the depression of your shoulder/weight into your mattress which will affect your sizing.  For instance, I am 6'2&#34; 245 lbs.  I have to use a L for the softer pillow top and an XL for the firmer day bed mattress.  If they are switched, I know and feel it the next day.  So if you are one of those who order this pillow and notice noticeable issues over the first couple days, I would recommend you reevaluate/exchange for different size. For me, the softer mattress forced me to step down a size to get a proper fit that worked for me.<br /><br />For me, this pillow is the answer for a good night's sleep, however, it MUST be the right size.",2015-08-14

I've normally avoided taking any kind of supplement and have instead opted to maintain a &#34;decent&#34;  diet and workout regiment when I can. As I've gotten older it's becoming more apparent that i need additional help. Something no man ever wants to admit. In come boostULTIMATE  It was a breeze to order and the product arrived at my home in a timely manner. I followed the directions randomly(mostly in the morning) taking 2 capsules a day. It was genuinely hard to tell if it was creating a difference in my energy output for the day. I think it was but wasn't really sure! Normally, I'm at my optimum in the mornings and start to dwindle shortly after lunch (1pm-4pm).  To get a better gauge of if the product worked or not. I decided to start taking it shortly after lunch. I noticed a small difference in energy level, mostly in not feeling as sleepy as i would normally around that time. Nothing crazy like bouncing off the wall. But a slight improvement. That in itself for someone like me with lots to do during the course of the day gets a NOD!  Thank you! Will try some of the other products for comparison.",2015-08-13

It interfaced with Cyclometer version 1.0.4.7 using their heart rate monitor add in, and worked very well.  The only thing I had issues with is the chest band. It is one continuous loop, which I expanded to its maximum, and it barely fit around my chest! Yes I have a 48 inch chest, but the fact that it could not be &#34;unbuckled&#34;, or &#34;un snapped&#34;, was a problem for me.<br /><br />When preparing for the fourth bike ride, I noticed that the sensor was paired with my phone but was not sending heart rate information to Cyclometer. To verify that there was no problem with the phone apps I reinstalled Cyclometer, and I installed Caledos Heart app. Neither app would register the heart rate.  I reviewed the instructions for the Zephyr and made sure the chest band was wet, and the unit was fully charged. This did not solve the problem.<br /><br />I contacted the Zephyr Technology company and requested assistance, using their website on July 20th. on July 21st, Jackie Fournier responded with an email outlining all the steps I had taken before contacting the company, and none of the steps fixed my problem. On July 21st I requested an RMA. On July 22nd, Jackie responded with the requested RMA.

It was on sale so I decided to give it a try. I have known about cacao health benefits for a long time and in the past I bought some raw nibs from a health food store. They ended up tasting horrible and I threw them out. I was nervous about this powder but I have to say that I really enjoy it! It really smells like chocolate and provides a familiar chocolate taste to my protein shakes. It is easily mixable and blends perfectly in a high speed blender. It also gives me a nice boost of clean energy. I feel very energized focused about thirty minutes after drinking my shake when I add the cacao powder. I have recently been having some major hormonal issues and after reading many conflicting studies on the effects of cacao I am deciding to cut way back on my intake of the powder I bought. I've been putting about 2 tablespoons in my daily protein shake for a few weeks and I have had some strange onset of hormone disruption symptoms which I have never had in my life and I am young.

This product also relieves bloating that is present for me.  It also gets rid of stomach aches for me.  I use this topically with 3-5 drops being rubbed around the center of my abdomen area.  I believe it would be best if I used it daily as a regular routine but to be honest I just use it when I have bloating, a stomach ache or constipation.  I was very skeptical that essential oils would work as I've mainly relied on Western medicine for my ulcerative colitis.<br /><br />I would encourage you to buy this product - even if you think essential oils and Eastern-homeopathic treatments seem like &#34;hocus pocus&#34;.  You will be very surprised that they do indeed work.  I attribute this to essential oils being the purest form of natural medicine.  Our society didn't always have Walgreens or Norvatis and Pfizer to sell and manufacture western medication.  Before these amenities, natural remedies where passed down through generations and herbs and the like were gathered.

US,21330911,RI2KX2796U32D,B00NU6H3PQ,915831084,Taylor Bluetooth Body Fat Smart Scale w/ 400 lb Capacity and SmarTrack App,Personal_Care_Appliances,4,1,1,N,N,Decent Smart Scale with Lots of Features,"The packaging for the Taylor scale is very nice looking with lots of information all over it about the scale.<br /><br />Inside you’ll find the scale packaged well with packaging material on the sides and then the scale is wrapped in plastic. You’ll also find the batteries and the user guide in there.<br /><br />The Taylor scale is made from tempered glass and it looks very nice. There are two metal strip on each side of the top of the scale and these are not for decoration, they’re actually capacitive sensors. To use the smart functions and get the most out of the scale you actually have to be barefoot with your feet on the sensors to get the correct measurements. It’s glass so it’s kind of heavy at about four pounds and it measures in at 11.8”x11.8”.<br />At the top center of the scale is the LCD display with touch sensitive button under it for various settings, the display measures 2” x 3”.<br /><br />The back or bottom of the scale has found rubber feet to make sure it stays in place and you’ll find some basic directions there as well.<br />The battery compartment is off to the top left side and it uses three AAA batteries for power which they do include for you.<br />At the top right side you’ll find a small button that is used for changing the units and for pairing Bluetooth.<br /><br />Usage/Testing:<br /><br />The display is large at 2”x3” but the actual weight doesn’t take up much space as the rest of the display is for the other functions and information. The numbers and letters are black and honestly I would rather have them a bit larger.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can be used just as a regular scale and you don’t even have to use all the Bluetooth and ‘smart’ functions, you can just weigh yourself and you’re done.<br /><br />I recently went to the doctors and their scale said I weighed 171lbs and my other digital scale said I weigh 171lbs as well and the Taylor scale says I weigh 170.8lbs. Yes the Taylor scale didn’t give me the same exact weight as my other scale, but all scales are different from what I’ve found. I think .2lbs difference is well within an acceptable margin of error,  either way .2lbs difference isn’t much and I can say the Taylor scale is accurate. 170.8 and 171lbs to me is close enough to call it accurate. I know the doctors scale is accurate, at least it’s supposed to be, and I probably had things in my pocket at the doctor as well.<br /><br />The Taylor scale is a smart scale with Bluetooth so if you really want to get the most out of it you need to use it with an iOS or Android device. I have Android so I downloaded the Taylor SmartTrack app to my HTC One M7 phone.<br />You’ll need to create an account and input some information like gender, birthday, body style, height, your goals and other basic stuff.<br /><br />Pairing the scale over Bluetooth was a bit tricky, it took me several times to get it paired but once it was paired it worked fine, it was just a bit frustrating at first. You need to make sure you read the directions, you really can’t just jump in and try pairing it.<br />Once connected there are a few options you can change like the units and the account paired with the app.<br /><br />The app itself has two modes essentially with several pages.<br />As I mentioned you need to be barefoot when using this scale, not sure I like that but whatever right?! The scale can measure weight, fat mass, muscle mass, body and show calories you should be eating.<br /><br />If you press each display you’ll then be taken to a graph so you can visually chart your progress for each category, this can be very handy for keeping track of you goals and overall health.<br /><br />The scale does allow you to have more than one person or accounts paired with it which is great for families of course.<br /><br />The Taylor Bluetooth Smart scale is a decent choice I think if you’re very much into fitness as it really can help you keep track of your goalsand help you work to attain them.<br /><br />We live in a very connected world and the scale can connect to your phone or tablet, iOS or Android, through the free Taylor app or you can use other popular fitness apps with it.<br /><br />The most important thing for a scale is accuracy and I would have to say the Taylor scale is accurate, it’s only .2lbs difference from my other other scale and that’s very much in an acceptable margin of error, .2 lbs isn’t much at all.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can offer a lot of information about your health and help you stay and/or get healthy.<br /><br />The only real complaints I could have about the Taylor scale is the numbers and letters on the display are a bit small, bigger would be better here. Bluetooth connection is a bit tricky, it took me a few times to get it paired.<br /><br />All in all it’s not a bad product, it’s very well made, it looks great and it can be very useful and helpful.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Seems accurate<br />+Looks very nice<br />+Lots of features and information<br />+Very well made<br />+Works with Taylor app and/or other popular fitness and health apps<br />+Works with iOS and Android<br />+Can be used as just a scale<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Bluetooth connection can be tricky<br />-Numbers are a bit small<br /><br />Please Note: I received this product for review for free/discounted in exchange for my unbiased reviewin a very connected world and the scale can connect to your phone or tablet, iOS or Android, through the free Taylor app or you can use other popular fitness apps with it.<br /><br />The most important thing for a scale is accuracy and I would have to say the Taylor scale is accurate, it’s only .2lbs difference from my other other scale and that’s very much in an acceptable margin of error, .2 lbs isn’t much at all.<br /><br />The Taylor scale can offer a lot of information about your health and help you stay and/or get healthy.<br /><br />The only real complaints I could have about the Taylor scale is the numbers and letters on the display are a bit small, bigger would be better here.

My fiance works in a warehouse anywhere between 8-13 hours a day 5 to 6 days a week so he really has an aching back as well as some joints that definitely could use some TLC after work. The day I got this in the mail I used this on my fiances back when he got off work and he absolutely loved it. He loved the way it felt and that I could apply as little or as much pressure as he wanted/needed instead of being stuck with just one pressure level. This massager stick definitely gets deep into the muscles and gives them a great massage. We both took turns with this massager stick and both really like the way it makes our muscles feel afterwards. This massager stick is very easy to use. It would be a great gift or you can just keep it for yourself!

The mood/night lights are great too. It has several colors that it can cycle through or you can choose your favorite color.  Its super easy to use and clean. Twist it open, pour in your water using the provided pitcher, add some oils if you like, twist the lid back on and turn it on. Its that easy. This one produces a spread out larger mist compared to others that we have. I could smell the oil I added immediately. It has an auto turn off too which is nice. Fill it and forget it. When it gets low on water it will beep twice and turn off. For the price this has been a very nice diffuser for us.<br />I am giving the Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Diffuser by URPOWER a 5 star review. If you are looking for a large diffuser that won't break your bank then I would suggest you give this a try.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br /><br />I was provided with a sample for free or at a discount price in exchange for my honest review.",2015-08-09

It might help that I am a chemist, so rather than give up when there were problems I tried to figure out why, and have the background to do so. I did call the folks at ahhNatural when I bought a new hottub and it was much harder to start up with this system than the 15 year old one that had been using toxic halogen soup. The old one I drained and flushed, and it didn't really have any issues staying beautiful and clear.<br />The new one...I finally got the company (mfr) to admit that they flushed them ( they have to leak test the thing before they ship them) with water and probably by the time I got it it had developed some bacterial issues. Had I used their toxic chemical soup to start up the new one, it would have been fine. But I didn't know, and the first fill rapidly was overcome by the crap in the new tub. I drained it, did a chlorine shock, drained it again, and refilled with a fresh bag, peroxide and salt.<br />This is a FABULOUS system. My skin feels soft and I can stay in the tub for an hour if I like and no wrinkled prune when I get out.<br />Whoever says it doesn't work didn't understand the chemistry and perhaps didn't get help or follow directions to fix it. I've found the company knowledgable and eager to help.<br />Get rid of the nasty toxic chemical soup in your tub and go NATURAL!<br />Oh, they do say if your tub has very heavy use or people who party in it without a shower first, it will likely need more peroxide and frequent filter changes.

I have ordered several Viva Labs products and find them ALL to be of high quality. This cacao powder is a very fine powder that disappeared in seconds when I added it to my hot cocoa recipe in hot milk, but left a very thin, chalky feel in my mouth that wasn't offensive in any way-just noted. The taste is absolutely sinfully rich and actually made my plain oatmeal exciting again! I'm a diabetic looking for new ways to have my chocolate addiction satisfied without all the sugar, and am very excited about all the ways this will help. I tried stirring this into cold milk-it was a chore, or maybe a labor of love(?), but in time doable, and I enjoyed it, too! Some may call me crazy on that one! It blended well with a brownie recipe and made the baking aroma heavenly, and the taste was amazing with no residue left behind. I will do without before I ever bake another brownie with store Cocoa.

It has light and mist button on the front. When you press light button once it will keep changing the color itself. If you press again the light button the same color will stays on. For mist you can set timer for 60 180 360  minutes or ON. It indicates with the green dot light which option has been chosen.<br />It comes with the cup to pour water, power cable, user manual and the diffuser.<br />It is was very easy and simple to use the diffuser.<br />Pour water and add few drops of your favorite essential oil. I use lavender as it works great for me. Put the top part back on and plug in the power cable.<br />If you can also light off the light if you want. It can also work as a night light while working as a diffuser. ( Do not turn it on without water to use as night light)<br />I use this diffuser in my bedroom at night and sleep peacefully. The mist from diffuser keeps purifies the air and I can easily breathe. The aromatherapy really helps to relief the stress and improves the immune system.<br />The user manual guides in detail how to clean the diffuser. Keep in mind for diffuser's life cleaning it weekly is recommended.<br />I am satisfied with its performance and durability.<br />I would highly recommend this diffuser.<br />I am so glad I got this diffuser on a promotion in exchange of an unbiased and honest opinion.",2015-08-07

Comfortable and well made,"I honestly didn't have much expectation for this belt and would laugh at the absurdity of people actually thinking this could do anything for them. I was offered one to test and evaluate its efficiency and thought this was the perfect  opportunity to completely come out with how ridiculous they really are but after using it for 5 days now I have to bow my head and admit I was very wrong. I have lost almost a full inch off of my waist and I changed nothing about my diet or exercise other than wearing this belt. I put it on before work at 11a.m. and have been wearing it until dinnertime around 5:30 every evening. It actually hides well under clothes, you obviously can't wear tight fitting shirts and it be unnoticed but for casual fits you really can't tell. I like that It holds me snugly but I'm still able to move freely and handle my day to day responsibilities without being hindered by the belt. It does make you sweat but only inside the belt and doesn't give you gross sweat marks on your clothes. It is machine washable so won't get all stinky and nasty. I will say I'm impressed. My only issue was that it did roll up at the bottom over my hips but under pants with a good supporting closure (like jeans) it is kept flat. I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually WILL continue to use this belt and would even recommend it. I did receive mine free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after thorough testing.",2015-08-06

I can't recall the exact model; but it was one of Norelco's better (and higher priced) models.  I was satisfied with it; and It lasted about 10 years.  When it failed, I searched a wide variety of brands and models; but, in the end, I decided to stay with Norelco and felt it was the best value.  I have had it now for about a month.  I believe that it actually gives a closer shave than my previous Norelco (which, admittedly, was overdue for new replacement heads).  I found that, after charging it, I was able to get 21 shaves before a recharge was required.  (It also seemed to take far less time to recharge than what was advertized.)  It can be used in the shower; so, you don't have to worry about getting it wet while cleaning it.  However, I found that after cleaning it (with water), you need to hold it in an upright position and shake it a bit to get the water out of it. Otherwise, when you pick it up, water will leak out of the bottom (where you would plug it in for recharging).  The Pop-Up Trimmer is a bit noisier than my previous Norelco, but not dramatically so.  I prefer a dry shave and do not use it with shaving gel and/or in the shower, so I cannot address that feature.  All in all, I'm quite pleased with it and would highly recommend it.",2015-08-05

I have tried all different pillow forms, materials and price ranges with sadly no success.<br />Did some research and purchased this one. For me there<br /> was a 2 night adjustment period. I shake the buckwheat to one end of pillow case and fold the case over to create a thicker sleeping surface for side lying support and now love the benefits of a better night of sleep.  Big benefit for me and husband; this disapates the pillow-head-heat build up for those of us living in the hot/humid south! Even better I gave it to my husband to test it out for a few nights and found his loud snoring has gone away! Now, I am purchasing another one for me. There is some noise from the buckwheat shifting when repositioning the head, but none that is bothersome for us. If you are a hyper -sensitive sleeper this may not be for you. Also I strongly suggest purchasing a lightly padded zippered pillow cover. Be advised this is not a soft fluffy material.

I truly love the flavor of this tea, and it makes me feel better whenever I finish a cup of it.<br /><br />The effects are really positive, I have the more urges to go to the bathroom and pee. I am feel less bloated, yet hydrated. My body feels lighter. I combine this tea with exercise and a weightloss supplement. I don't think this tea will help you lose weight if you dont help yourself to lose weight. You have to work and exercise for it to happen. This tea will work if you work.<br /><br />Overall I definitely love this tea, I love the taste and flavor. I will be trying their other variety of teas as this one impressed me. I purchased this using a promo code for testing.",2015-08-05

In this 3 day class, it required that we switch partners around and every single person that lain on my table RAVED about how my table was the softest, most comfortable table in the group! The fleece is soft, and PLUSH! It fit the table well with no issues and as a therapist, when you lean into the table or have to stabilize yourself against it, it is so soft and comfy! Your hip or leg (depending on the height of the table) is very much well cushioned.<br />I LOVE it and so did all of the seasoned massage therapists in my class.

What I've observed with this brush is that, as a few other people have noted, a brownish colour bleeds into the shaving cream in the first few uses. Of course, I cleaned the brush before I used it. Also, I've been using the brush every day for a week and it's still losing a few hairs each shave. It's possible that I am being too aggressive with the brush though.<br /><br />If I am too aggressive, it's because the brush is quite soft and I am cursed with near-steel facial hair and sensitive skin. Getting the hair on my face to lift while trying to avoid overstimulating the skin on my face is a bit of a challenge with a brush as soft as this. That all said, the brush does its job and does not cause any discomfort.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice brush compared to the brushes I was able to find locally (which were either super-cheap or massively overpriced). Also, it's much much better than fingertips! I think a brush like this may be better for people with finer hair or young people who do not yet get a 5 o'clock shadow, however. I will probably try a boar hair brush next to see if that's more suitable.",2015-08-03

However, I feel the need to write a review to anyone who has gone through hell and back with back pain.<br /><br />I've had two knots on each side of my back for months that have made it hard to sit or stand for long periods of time. I've gone to my chiropractor and a massage therapist, neither of which were really able to fully get to the knot and release it. The last massage I had, the massage therapist told me about getting a theracane to help with the tight muscles because not even she could get far enough down to reach the knots I had.<br /><br />Instead of a theracane I chose the Body Back Buddy. It's made of a very solid, well made heavy duty plastic that doesn't feel cheap or flimsy so I'm not afraid to lean into it or lay on pressure points. The most impressive thing for me was that after some maneuvering and finding which knob would work best, I instantly felt it hit a pressure point and release it. After using it religiously for 3 days, my back is probably 90% less tight, my knots have almost totally been loosened and I can walk further, longer and sit or stand for a longer period of time without the fear of having to find a chair to rest due to pain.<br /><br />It sounds corny but after living with pain for such a long time any relief at all is welcomed and I'm so glad I was able to stumble across this gadget to offer me relief without drugs or a huge expense. I plan on using it until my knots are totally gone and even then, will treat any that pop up in the future.",2015-08-03

When they arrived and I felt how heavy they are I was skeptical but decided to at the very least try them out for a couple of nights.  When you put your head on them or move your head they are somewhat noisy, sort of a crunching sound.  The sound is slightly alarming at first but honeslty not a big deal at all once you are situated.  In fact these pillows hold your neck and head EXACTLY how you settle in for the duration of your rest or until you readjust.  I have never had a pillow that does what these pillows do, boy do I wish I had tried one of these out years ago.  My wife agrees 100% about how much better her sleep has been with these pillows.  She has a bulging disc in her neck and finds that it is no longer uncomfortable to sleep on the tender side.  I have read where people have said these pillows are cooler, which is sort of true.

At first, I was hesitant to spend so much on something that I wasn't sure would work for me at all, but the ratings convinced me.<br /><br />Two years ago this October, I had vaginal reconstructive surgery due to a birth defect. Prior to this surgery, I was unable to use tampons or have a pelvic exam, let alone have sex. A q-tip inserted by my doctor was painful. My doctor performed the surgery and after healing, I was able to use tampons. However, after many failed, frustrating attempts of having sex with my ex, and lots of research, I realized that I had vaginismus. After my last relationship ended and I began dating the man I am with now, who was very loving and understanding about this, I decided I really needed to do something about this. I did my research and felt like these were the best. Prior to the dilators, I had only been able to have maybe an inch or two of penetration without being in incredible pain. I have worked with these dilators every day and slept with them in almost every night since July 8th. This product has changed my life! I was able to surpass the first dilator after the first few nights and gradually worked my way up to the fourth. I hadn't attempted the fifth, but wanted to see if I had made much progress.

It has been around town and I needed to buy it due to not getting enough out of the smaller batteries.<br />This was my first &#34;mod&#34;.<br />My first puff on this device was WOW. Lots and LOTS of vapor and it hit was very strong. It even has a very warm vape, very much like a cigarette. Even using a menthol juice it was a warm hit.<br />If you are trying to quit smoking or need to upgrade from your current set up to a mod, this is what you need. It's 'simple' enough you won't break it too easily and the draw is perfect.<br />That being said, I don't know a lot about mods and I can honestly say looking at the thing I felt slightly lost but I went online and found reviews of the mod to find out what all I needed to do to rebuild the RBA. I actually burned out the 1.5 coil because I topped it out on 50wats right off the batt...newbie mistake. The product came with full instructions and told me what I did wrong. So make sure you read and research all the stuff about the mod before trying to use it. It comes with clear instructions, a white and black drip tip, all the thingsneeded for the RBA, a 1.5 and .5 head (the premade heating coils), and of course it came with the tank and the mod itself. The batteries are not included but aren't too expensive. I made the mistake of buying batteries AND a battery charger but this mod has a built in charging port. This means you place your battery in the mod and plug up the charge cord to your PC. The battery lasts me two days and I'm a heavy vaper.<br />My two big reasons I put only four stars: One, the battery cover is magnetized and does not line up perfectly. There's a tiny gap at the top of the battery cover (see photos). And TWO I've had this three days or so and haven't dropped the tank but magically a chip is already missing from the tank's white color (see photos).<br />But over all this mod is a rather good buy and does it's job well! For a beginner it's an awesome buy. It has some small issues but only comedic. When you look past that it does it's job and is a very s  mooth little device. I plan to purchase another one for my husband since he loves it as much as I do.<br /><br />Also a side note, I bought blue rings for my mod to jazz it up a bit and it turned out on the side there's a little window where you can see the battery so my battery was blue also and it all worked out together. But if your battery is a different color you don't want to show then the you're in luck because the mod comes with a sticker that is black to cover the battery so it wont shine through the battery window. The photos show where the window is.<br /><br />I have used kangertech products before and this is just another amazing product they offer!<br />I recommend it!t has some small issues but only comedic.

Great shave with fewer blades in a smaller cartridge. Much like its ‘big brother’ Schick Hydro 5, this '3 blade-four cartridge' refill pack gives as good a shave as those 4 and 5 blade cartridges that make it feel like you are shaving with a billboard. This cartridge allows the user to get into tight corners and angles on the cheeks, chin, and neck. The cartridge characteristics are:  + it contains 3 ultra glide blades with 'skin guards' that smooth and protect the skin; + the `aloe' gel reservoir hydrates throughout the shave reducing friction; + the 3 blades are closely grouped to allow raising and cutting the hairs in the beard.  In testing, this 3 blade cartridge: + yields up to 4 weeks of use and a smooth shave each time with either gel or soap-based shaving cream; + the aloe gel system appears to work as well as the other Schick cartridges. + there is no separate, deployable trimmer on this model.  I'm a fan of the Schick two-blade cartridge, but this one is enough to make me change to the Hydro 3, promising 3 to 4 weeks of close shaves from the 4 cartridges. The price is right and  the blades are long-lasting. Highly Recommended. Five SHARP Stars (4 each Schick Hydro 3 Sensitive Refill Cartridges.)",2015-08-01

Super heavy.  I mean seriously, heavy.  That I can deal with, but not easy to deal with when repositioning it during the night.  which brings be to point 3... 3. Difficult to position, shape to fit your neck or whatever part of you that needs support.  Very difficult.  After fooling around with it for over 30 minutes, I literally threw it off the bed in frustration.  My cat began digging on it like it was a litter box, so I put it back up on the bed and decided to try again after my arms rested.  I'm 55 and have neck issues that has caused some numbness and loss of strength in my arms...probably a common problem for buyers of this pillow. 4. It feels like you're sleeping on a bag of yard work.  Which, in some ways, you are.  I've used buckwheat pillows before that were far superior to this.

I had to contact Amazon in order to get the seller just to ask if I already returned it and why, I thought the product was unsatisfactory, I replied. The seller did not follow up.

Construction feels solid. It's not a real straight razor, nor should it be expected to be in terms of comfort and quality, so the rating is given exclusively on its own merit. The only downside for me is the blade exposure - not quite enough for me, though that's fixed by changing up my grip a bit. Blades were a 4 rating for me - not my favorites, but certainly not bad. I am accustomed to Red Personnas when using a double-edge, but an 8000 grit edge on a straight, so the Derbys are right in between for sharpness, and just a bit harsher than both.<br /><br />5 stars for convenience, 4 for operability, 4 for shave quality.

This is the second product I've tried that contains aloe, and both have had the same effect of growing skin too rapidly before the treatment has a chance to heal the skin properly.  About a week in, I had spots on my left hand that began to itch where I haven't had psoriasis for years .  So if you have a similar effect to other aloe-containing products steer clear.

Era Organics also sells this wonderful product.<br />My routine consists of using a straight razor twice a week to remove dead skin after a shower, then using pine tar soap (I've heard black soap works great as well) combined with a microplane/rasp twice daily, then moisturizing with Metaderm.  This, along with ~4000IU of vitamin D daily, plenty of sunlight, and a healthy diet keeps my condition under control and barely visible.<br /><br />***update 8/30/15***<br /><br />As soon as this was posted, Tyler (the company's owner) emailed me with some suggestions, such as only using Dr. Bronner's soap and other more natural pH skin restoring products, and that to use the Era cream as much as I needed.  I decided to try another month, and although the condition was improving, after I ran out of the cream I switched back to MetaDerm Hyper (still using Dr. Bronner's), and I now am using less product (2-3 applications daily rather than 4+ with Era) and don't have to remove as much skin.

Apparently it's a &#34;once a year&#34; type thing. Who knew?!<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find this tube, identical to the one I had, here on Amazon for about half the price. It attaches to the machine and the CPAP recognizes it as a ResMed product, so it regulates the temperature and humidity perfectly. That is the great thing about this heated tubing, no more condensation and being blown in the face by that moisture... I used to hate that! Sound asleep and suddenly you think you're drowning!!

Everything is not dull like most sets that you get,there sharp and ready to be used.<br />For me though, my daughter has kidnapped this from me,so I am going to sneak back in her room tomorrow while she is at work and take it back lol.

I've used testosterone shots from the Dr at $500 a month to achieve test levels to that of a much younger man, but it just got too expensive to maintain. Also if your familiar with how test works in your body after a shot my levels increased dramatically. but it cycles through your system in 6-7 days.

Feeling great half the time and sluggish and lazy the other. My wife notices the difference big time in the bedroom. I've also tried many over the counter testosterone boosters. I've had decent results with most but not quite the same as those injections. I've been desperate to  find a test booster that allows me to grow and maintain not only my muscle size but also in the bedroom as well, without the expense and the up and downs associated with test injections. Well everything has changed for me after discovering Boost Ultimate.it is by far the strongest most potent test booster I've ever used. If you have never tried Boost Ultimate I highly recommend you do now! The feeling of strength, energy, and the desire to make love to my wife reminds me of when we 1st got married.

I used it twice a day for one week and each time I applied it she scream &#34;owwwwieee!!!&#34; I am guessing it hurt her because she doesn't do this with any other lotion or medication I use on her. Her skin was reddened after application so maybe she was allergic to something in it? I used it on myself and didn't notice anything beneficial nor harmful. It did not seem very moisturizing, however. For now, my family will stick to pure organic ivory Shea butter, which works best for us and is non-irritating.

There are no irritating logos on the sides or gaudy decals/decorations. They do not come with a case but they do come with a microfiber cleaning rag. Hinges are stainless steel looking and are spring loaded and seem durable. Bifocal at bottom of lens does not span totally across the bottom but doesn't seem to be an issue.  Unfortunately, most sunglasses either fail at the hinges, lenses fall out from cleaning or some other defect. These seem like they might have a chance being more durable.

I tried putting it on three times a day and a thick layer before I go to bad and wear cotton gloves, still, not much improvement :(  It does stop the itchiness, but does not help with the cracking at all.

Destroyed my livelihood for a while!,"I bought this during the summer of 2013 because of an eHow article suggestining it to cool your room. On the product it showed that it can be used in any part of the house. When I first started using it I accidently spilled some on the carpet but did clean it up. I don't remember how so I may have not done a proper clean up. On the product it says to wash the area of the spill. Anyway, I set it beside my bed. I had an oscilating fan blowing over it about 5 feet away. I don't remember the condition of the environment of my room, i.e. whether the A/C was on or if I had left the window open or if the window was closed and no a/c. I also live in a humid area with temps up to 90 fehrenheit.<br />I leave for a vacation for a few weeks and then return to find that my whole apartment is toxic. The items in my room stink of this sour odor; my watch, my weights, etc. is stinky. Everything was contaminated. When I go to take a shower my nose is burning, my eyes, and it probably irritated my esophagus, but I'll go into this later. So I immedietely throw away ALL my stuff, including furniture. I go to live with someone else and turn the A/C on as simply opening the windows did not help a bit. I later vigorously  cleaned the carpet with a water vacuum. My aparentment was inhabitable for a long while.<br />I had called Damprid support and spoke with them about the smells and my problems, but they acted stupid. They told me &#34;it's just a salt&#34;. Seriously? Are they so stupid that they don't know calcium chloride is a dangerous chemical? You can't even touch this stuff and if you do you have to wash your hands really, really well. It's not &#34;just a salt&#34;. It should have more warnings so people take more care to clean spills very, very well and not to touch this stuff, and by all means AVOID it in rooms with fans. But it doesn't look like Damprid cares. Just another uncaring business.<br />So to everyone using this stuff, please don't make the mistakes I made. I did fully recover from my symptoms but I'm not sure my esophagus is what it was before as I had lots of burning.",2015-07-23

These Phillips-Norelco razors work great - until they don't.  When they don't, it is because the on-off switch fails.  Yeah, you can turn them on & off with a paper clip - sometimes - after the switch breaks - but not all the time. Mine last up to 18 months until the switch fails.

I am 31, and have been battling eczema for over 15 years now.  While many, many other creams tend to stop working after a week or two, this magical elixir has been added as the final stage of my hygiene routine and over time, the itch is gone. My skin now thirsts for this cream as soon as I towel myself off after the shower, it almost demands it. The cream feels silky in my hand, it's incredibly non-greasy, and smells fantastic to me. I know others didn't like the scent, but it reminds me of a cocoa butter mixed semi-sweet chocolate scents. It doesn't leave the skin greasy or dry at all after it is applied, it is absorbed within 10 minutes and leaves my skin with a cool, refreshing feeling. If you love the feeling of your mouth after brushing your teeth, you will love the way your skin feels cool and refreshed. I waited a few months before glowing about this product, but I don't think it's going to stop working any time soon.

It covers the whole chair bottom.  The first time I sat on it, I noticed that my back had less tension and I sat up straighter with less effort.  I am guessing that this is because of the space on the back of the cushion.  It feels like it gives my spine more room in the sitting position to stretch out and relax.  The foam this cusion is made of is not the dense, stiff memory foam that takes a while to expand after you compress it.  This foam moves with you and has a little spring to it.  One thing I would add to this cushion is some grippers on the bottom.  It is not much of an issue on upholstered surfaces, but it slides around on wood and other smooth surfaces.

All four sides are initially labeled with the order you need to use them. But as you use block, the wording will fade away. Not an inconvenience for my daughter who has memorized what order to use each color.<br /><br />The block works just as you would expect it to. Start with the baby blue edge to smooth and shape your nail edge. You can also use this side to smooth out any deep ridges on your nail face. Next use the pink side to smooth not so deep ridges on your nail face. Then the dark blue side will smooth your nail face even more. And last but not least, the green side will shine your nail face.<br /><br />My daughter uses this almost everyday and it has held up very well. And she keeps getting complements on how well her nails look!  Many people assume that she uses a clear cost nail polish when in reality she isn't.<br /><br />The file sides are glued on to a rectangular foam block that has a little five to it. It weighs nothing, and has just enough flex in it to make it comfortable to use. No side has come unglued, nor has anything started peeling off. It is very well constructed. We clean it by gently rubbing a damp wash cloth over each side and letting it dry overnight. But we only clean it when needed and not everyday.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product.",2015-07-18

It has on one side a velcro that cover the full 8 inches of length. What I like about the waist trimmer:<br />+ the inner material makes you sweat for sure<br />+ it is wide enough to cover the mid section<br />+ it can go under loose clothing without standing out<br /><br />Cons<br />- the velcro cover the full side, it can be very uncomfortable if it hits the skin. I usually secure it diagonally, that way the velcro won't hit my skin<br />- the sides are not stitched, after a while the upper material will start rolling down. Also because of this, it doesn't have extra support. So when you over stretch it, it will start curling down your belly.<br />- material is not breathable. You can not keep it on over night, as the rubber won't let your skin breath. 1-2 hours are just fine.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars and not less, because when you wear it, especially while working out, it will make you sweat. It does the job, I just like my other one better. The other one is longer, velcro is in the middle extended out from the belt. And the material is breathable.<br />I was asked to review the belt by belly blaster. I received it for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",2015-07-17

US,49329369,R2DJ07TH1ZHIEO,B00XZJ2G46,217870256,"Vision Spinner II Variable Voltage Battery, 1600mAh",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,7,8,N,Y,Oldskool eGo guy tells all,"Update Aug 23:  I've mostly solved the &#34;invisible button&#34; issue by asking my wife to paint the button with red nail polish.  It still allows the light to show through and makes it easier to find the button visually.  --------------------------------------------------  This will be a review of the Spinner II vs the original Spinner vs the eGo USB vs the eGo-C vs the eGo variable voltage wired pass-thru. I've been using eGo systems and accessories since their inception, so I can tell you about all there is to know, I guess.  I'd been using various drip systems when I found the eGo drip version, liked the long-lasting rechargeable 350mw battery that was so much more simple than removable batteries, so I've stuck with a simple system that worked well for many years.  Pretty much the only changes I've made were increasing battery capacity and going to the simple Innokin Clearomizer tank system.  It's a system that is fairly durable, makes enough vapor to satisfy me but not make a cloud that is so obvious that I'm easily detected in questionable zones.  But you only want to know about the batteries, particularly the Spinner II... and you guys that use baseball bat sized battery systems that you still have to drip into so you can make an explosion of vapor are not going to be interested in an eGo anyway... so here goes:  The new Vision Spinner II differs from the original first of all that it is more powerful (1600mw vs 1200) and about a 5/8 of an inch longer, but since the switches are located at about the same place, I doubt there is &#34;actual&#34; battery located in the extra length.  It's a tiny bit heavier and about the same diameter... see attached pic.  At the 3.8 volt setting, both of my vision batteries make the same amount of vapor as does the USB battery.  I use 3.8 volts because the higher settings tend to make me go through atomizers and liquid faster as well as charring the liquid and making it taste bad after a tank or two.  Other points for the new Spinner version are a detented control that has a slotted bottom that I guess is intended for a coin in case you don't have a strong grip.  The old version turned more easily and just had a narrow grip that turned way too easily and often got reset accidentally.  Also the place at the top where you used to be able to screw on a &#34;beauty ring&#34; is gone, which allows the overall length to be less... you can see from the pic that the black battery portion is about an inch longer in the new unit, but overall length is only a half inch or so longer.  My single complaint would be the button, which is only to be found by looking for it... you can't find it by touch like on the old one, but that's fine with me.  Other guys have complained here about the top breaking loose when they carry the unit in their jeans pocket, and that's a design flaw in the original and all other eGo batteries.  Don't put them in your jeans pocket.  I usually just keep mine in my hand since I constantly puff, but if you go into a restricted zone you'll need to find a hiding place.  Pants with long, low pockets are good.  I still have and use ALL of the battery systems listed on the top line of this review and tend to use the pass-thru more than any other, simply because I am a computer addict as well as e-vapor addict... so that's where I usually hang out.  I prefer this new Spinner II simply because it has a powerful, long lasting battery and allows me to be mobile for longer times.  Of course I have a 4amp charger in the car, so I don't often get caught with dead batteries anyway, but of all of the systems listed here, the USB's seem to last the shortest time before expiring forever.  I've broken many in jeans, and I've worn many out, but I'm not ready to go to a baseball bat sized battery either.  I like this one and hope you will to.  I'll update if I have any problems to tell about.",2015-07-16

It could be a 3 or 5 star depending on your use.    To start, the length of the block is about 3.5 inches (~9cm). Sides 1&3 are about 1 inch in height while sides 2&4 are are 1 1/4 inches in height. I couldn't figure out why there's a size difference except maybe a manufacturing reason. It really shouldn't make much of a difference.    It made with a foam block with each of the sides glued to it. For occasional home use, this should hold up just fine (watch out cats like these!). With heavy use, I'm a little hesitant if it would hold up.    One thing to consider is that this isn't a 6 step buffer. A six step buffer would give you a more gradual transition between each of the steps, perhaps giving you a little bit better of a job.    If your nails are in bad shape, you might want to go to a nail salon and get them to a place that you could use this for maintenance. This tool isn't quite robust enough to tackle tough jobs, but it would be great for maintaining nails.    Overall, you should be reasonably pleased with this. Sure, it might not be professional grade, but for the price it'll be hard to find something other than this for the same quality level.",2015-07-16

The plastic for the covers is far too fragile to last long. After only three weeks one of the doors snapped off in my hand. I hadn't even made it twice through the two weeks of pills that this box holds. I will be returning it immediately and looking for a replacement. My last box from Walmart lasted me 7 years. I didn't get a month from this one.<br /><br />INITIAL REVIEW: Great pill box.  Because each week is colored differently I can tell one week from another.  My last one was blue all over so I had to mark one Sunday as a starting point.  My only tiny complaint is that both weeks are lined up exactly day for day; meaning Sunday is over Sunday, etc.  This is different from my last box which had the weeks lines up back to back.  With he old one I would go down one row and up the other.  Now I have to be conscious to start from the left each time.  No big deal LOL.<br /><br />The covers snap in solidly and release once you push the side release button.  The covers snap on and off fairly hard which is great for not losing pills but could be a challenge for seniors who have weakness in their hands. But I'm also sure the effort needed will decrease as the box gets used and broken in.  All in all a good product that works well.  I would recommend it if it fits your need.",2015-07-15

After 22 years of smoking and multiple times of trying to quit I can't tell you how thrilled I am. I did order everything I needed online and saved a ton of money rather than buy it at the vape shop, between taxes and cost my savings was well over $50. I paired my Eleaf with the Aero Tank 2. When everything arrived I went to the vape shop and got my lesson and bought 3 vape flavors with 12mg nicotine....I was a pack a day smoker so that's what the shop recommended. There are so many vaping flavors out there that it is overwhelming but I eventually settled on Wild Blueberry, Vanillafied, and Strawberry Banana Ice Cream( my personal favorite). Three vape bottles cost me with tax around $27, and the rate I'm going through the juice VS. the cost of a pack of cigarettes, I can tell I'm probably going to easily save $60 a month. I have my stick set at 9.6 watts which seems to be perfect for me. Once you get your watts set, make sure you lock it by holding down both arrows at the same time. I forgot to lock mine and cranked up the watts while driving and didn't notice and yikes! I can already feel a difference in my lungs. I feel this is one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life and wish I would have done this years ago. Now I smell like a walking Yankee candle instead of a nasty stale bar. Hoping to go down to 6 mg of nicotine in a couple of months and then zero...then hopefully quit altogether. One step at a time though...and the red is actually hot pink(which being a girl didn't bother me, but guys unless you want a girly istick stay away from the red)",2015-07-15

They remind me of the smell of the florist section at Michael's. I think the obsessions about pumpkin lattes might make these more popular because I can see people adding these or the plain oil to make a better tasting pumpkin latte. I was surprised it was such a familiar taste that just reminds you of autumn because with the eucalyptus and cloves in it I thought it would taste like menthol but it really has a dominating cinnamon and orange flavor with the other oils just making it still smell more like an autumn brew of some kind.  I was a little worried these would make me be unfocused because my liver is so sensitive due to a candida infection I can't really drink alcohol and occasionally feel woozy from burnt oil or always from dark meat. I did not have any problem feeling woozy at all, and I was really surprised because I literally can get drunk from Rum Raisin ice cream or the wrong kind of vinegar. I also think this product is less toxic than soy sauce because I also can't use soy sauce without feeling tipsy. If I drink a Kambucha I basically also get drunk enough to feel like it was two or three beers for a healthy person. No problems with this though! I am very surprised, and I am going to keep using these. I want to add to the general conversations that I did have my infection through college but actually never caught a cough, cold, or sore throat for the first two years because I always washed my hands or used alcohol-spray hand sanitizer (bought) before touching my face or eating anything and it really was worth going to the trouble of always having the spray in my purse. It is so worth not being sick, especially because I was living in an apartment with three other girls who definitely would have gotten me sick! I also was not a clean freak during that time and really only kept my hands clean even though I constantly was typing in library settings late at night or working in public. Before I started college I caught a cold from getting ready to go and maybe that motivated me to stay healthy, but just that worked. After college I got lazy about cleaning my hands and did catch a nasty cold again which I think motivated me to keep my hands clean and I have not gotten a cold since! I also did not ever get a flu shot which I don't really think work. Nonetheless, I highly recommend these beadles to anyone with chronic problems!",2015-07-14

My back pain seems to get really bad when I’m standing for too long of a stretch of time or sitting for too long of a stretch of time. When I sit down to blog or go on our insanely long road trips my back shouts OOOOUUUCH at me. If your wondering what a road trip is to us, it can be anything from 1 hour to 27+ hours…my back isn’t having it.<br /><br />This is a pretty decent sized cushion. Not ridiculously big but a nice large size perfect for office chairs, or a driver’s or passenger’s seat in a car, I think you could even take it with you to any event you might be sitting at for long periods of time! I like that the cover has a zipper along one side so you can remove it and just toss it to wash if it gets dirty. I also have started putting it on the floor while I sit down with my 2 year old and almost 7 month old to play. Them being so young I sit on the floor a lot to be at their level and engage as much as possible with them. This is helping more than I thought it could during play time!<br /><br />It’s a full cushion made of memory foam which springs back up as soon as you get off it. I like that it’s not super squishy but a good mix of the soft squishy feeling of memory foam and a bit of firmness that helps you keep good posture while sitting. I’m sure this can only help with back pain as well! Once I sat it seemed to keep me sitting properly, I sat straight up, and I noticed I didn’t have that mid and lower back pain I’ve been dealing with for a long time. It might sound silly but I might be traveling everywhere I go with my seat cushion!<br /><br />You might not have thought about why your back is hurting but if you fix one of the main issues, how and where you chose to sit you might end up feeling a world of difference. Simply placing this cushion down before I sit has helped me immensely and I’m totally thankful to Xtreme Comforts because I’ve forgotten what it feels like to sit down for any length of time without having to fidget and move around to make my back stop aching!<br /><br />**I received a free product for a review.

Best Natural Moisturizer for Dermatitis, Rosacea, Shingles, Dry, Itchy Skin",Personal_Care_Appliances,5,0,0,N,N,Prurigo Nodularis is gone with the help of Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream,"I have had the Prurigo Nodularis extreme eczema for almost two years.  The itch is extremely intense and after 3 rounds of Prednisol and no relief in sight I did a lot of research and tried  homeopathic creams and herbal preparations before  I came across The Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream.  To my knowledge there are no other drugs available from Western Medicine only moisturizers which did not help in my case. I had consulted Five Dermatologists and was told this was my new life style.  I had a lot of open sores and lumps and bumps that itched incredibly.  When I purchased the first jar of Era Organics and I put the cream on immediately when it starts to itch, the itch will go away almost immediately. It is of most importance in my case with the Prurigo N. that the cream is applied immediately,that means about 4 to 5 times a day and before bed time.  I have been doing this for the last 2 months approximately and  my skin is improving after 18 months of horrible lumps and bumps. The itch is still there but minimal and immediately gone if I apply the Era Organics.  The most important thing is to apply immediately so you do not scratch and create more bumps.  I am pleased to have this cream and will be recommending it. I need to add to my original review.  4 months have passed after I used the Era Organics 4 x a day to eliminate the itching.  I needed to use it less and less and am happy to report that I have no more issues with the Prurigo Nodularis, except some scars left on my legs.  I have no further itching, or eczema and my legs are clear of any lumps and open sores.  This Era Organics Eczema & Psoriasis Cream was a major contributing factor in eliminating this extreme eczema. The other factors were herbal treatments and acupuncture.  I am convinced that without the Era Organics I would not have been able to stop the itching and the continued creating of new nodules and sores.  I strongly recommend this product for Prurigo Nodularis.",2015-07-14

By the time I've finished a half marathon, I look like Bobo the Clown!! To avoid that lovely post-race photo look, I usually use sugar-free cough drops which last in my mouth approximately 2.5 miles. I used to use Jolly Ranchers, but they became way too sweet after a short time.<br /><br />My friends have very politely informed me time and time again that I don't have the skill of chewing gum like a lady and that I should really not chew gum in public. Only those in my close circle see me chew gum at all, since I usually chew it at my desk/cubicle at work, or in the car when I'm driving.  Sometimes I chew it while I'm practicing the drums and I've even boldly chewed it during band practice - trust me when I tell you that people have joked about that too!<br /><br />Okay so this Run Gum™ is ah-mazing people and I'm being totally serious too. I've tried both flavors now and I can't even tell you which one I like better - they both taste great despite being sugar free. There's no icky taste to cover up caffeine like other performance gums, Run Gum just tastes like some good gum!<br /><br />Run Gum™ comes in individual packets with two pieces of gum inside. The instructions clearly advise users to chew one piece of Run Gum™ for mild effect and to chew two pieces for the full kick before they run. They go on to advise users to hew two pieces for &#34;full kick&#34;. Rum Gum™ advises that for best performance, chew a piece before any physical activity and chew another one upon completion. We recommend experimenting and finding what best works for you and your needs. We are all different and have different sensitivities to caffeine, so what works for one, may not work for all.<br /><br />Of course I failed to read these very clear instructions and proceeded to rip the packet open, pop both pieces in my mouth and jumped on the treadmill with the gum in my mouth. I even &#34;parked&#34; it for a time when I was concentrating on my running and when I swished it back, it was still great. It holds its flavor for a little bit longer than a cough drop too - I got three miles out of it before I knew I needed to get rid of it or my jaw would hurt LOL! This paragraph is being added to inform you to follow the Run Gum™ instructions and to not do what I did!<br /><br />Unlike many sources of caffeine that are high in sugar, Run Gum™ uses a combination of artificial sweeteners to provide a great tasting caffeine delivery method without unwanted sucrose.  The gum is available in two flavors, mint and fruit, Run Gum™ provides you with the performance enhancing chemicals your body needs in two delicious, candy coated pieces of chewing gum.<br /><br />Caffeine is a central nervous system and metabolic stimulant, and has been used both recreationally and medicinally to reduce physical fatigue and restore alertness when drowsiness occurs. Run Gum™ contains 50 mg. of caffeine. Taurine is an organic acid that is essential for cardiovascular function and the development and function of skeletal muscle, the retina, and the central nervous system. (Run Gum™ has 20 mg. of taurine.) Run Gum™ also contains a group of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. Best of all? NO CALORIES and sugar-free!!! yay!!!<br /><br />I received this product without cost in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion.tivity and chew another one upon completion.

The so-called &#34;Dutch&#34; method apparently destroys many of the helpful chemicals so eat  that chocolate for pleasure.<br /><br />Lower temperatures will preserve most of the health benefits, and the superb customer service representative at Viva (a nice lady named Vivian) gave me this information:<br /><br />&#34; I believe you are asking whether our cacao nibs and powder are raw, and in regards to this, It is very rare that cacao powder is raw. Unless it is developed using only a fermentation method, only then can it be marketed as a raw product. Oftentimes brands will claim their cacao is raw to appeal to various consumers as a marketing technique, however increasing temperatures is required in order to develop characteristic chocolate flavor. Temperatures are closely monitored with our cacao powder in order to preserve key nutrients and valuable compounds, and third-party analyses are conducted with every batch.<br /><br />&#34;Our cacao nibs are produced using a natural fermentation method. Temperatures do not exceed 114°F, thereby abiding by raw temperature limitations. The fermentation method yields a slightly tart flavor but still lends bold chocolate characteristics in recipes.&#34;<br /><br />Love the company and the customer service, love the sample provided to me for this review, and love the cacao.

I get from 10 - 12 days use from each mercury free battery, and one of them lasted 13 days.  I wear my hearing aids about 11 hours a day, so it's not as if I only wear them a small amount.  It occurs to me to add that I also use a remote with my hearing aids rather than having the volume control on the hearing aids themselves.  I am wondering if this fact somehow leads to longer battery life.  I have no idea about this and my audiologist didn't know either.  I mention it in case it might be a factor.
